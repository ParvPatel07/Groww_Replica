                <h1>Capital Gains Tax on Property</h1>
                <p>Many people are taxed on the sale of property as a significant tax event that takes into account the applicable capital gains tax, which is levied on the sale of property.</p>
                <h2>Capital Gains Tax on Property for STCG and LTCG</h2>
                <p>Capital gains tax on the sale of a property is generally determined by the time or duration of any capital asset. These capital gains are characterized as short-term or long-term, based on the duration, together with a subject – "holding period."</p>
                <p><em>For example:</em></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Property acquired or inherited such as residential property, equity shares, equity-oriented funds, automobiles, land, plot, gold, etc., are all considered capital assets. Any profit or gain from the sale of such assets is subject to capital gains tax.</li>
                    <li>In case your property-related income includes activities like purchasing capital assets, profits from the same are subject to capital gains tax.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Capital gains tax is also levied on the sale of inherited property or property received as a gift. The cost of acquisition for such property is considered as the cost to the previous owner. The holding period is also calculated from the date the previous owner acquired the property.</p>
                <h2>Long-Term Capital Gain and Short-Term Capital Gain</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>For dividing assets into long-term and short-term, there will also be a holding period: 36 months and 24 months, and 12 months for securities, including stocks and mutual funds.</li>
                    <li>All related securities with a holding period more than 36 months are considered Long Term.</li>
                    <li>The holding period of real estate is now 36 months. Therefore, an immovable property that is held for more than 36 months is considered a long-term capital asset.</li>
                    <li>STCG is the sale of an asset within 36 months from its acquisition date.</li>
                    <li>STCG on the sale of listed equity shares and equity-oriented mutual funds are taxable at 15% or 20%.</li>
                    <li>The taxation of LTCG on the sale of property and unlisted shares is at 20% with indexation.</li>
                    <li>The new rules propose that from July 2024, sale amount on assets held for less than 36 months will be taxed as short-term capital gains.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Capital gains on property are taxed differently based on these two types.</p>
                <p>There are two categories: short-term capital gain and long-term capital gain on the sale of property.</p>
                <table class="interval-table">
                    <thead>
                        <tr><th>Condition</th><th>Type of gain</th><th>Tax</th></tr>
                    </thead>
                    <tbody>
                        <tr><td>If property is held for less than 36 months</td><td>Short term gain</td><td>Tax will be added to the existing income of the individual and taxed as per the applicable slab rate.</td></tr>
                        <tr><td>If property is held after 36 months</td><td>Long term gain</td><td>20% (with indexation)</td></tr>
                    </tbody>
                </table>
                <h2>Calculation of Short-Term Capital Gain</h2>
                <p>To calculate short-term capital gain, you should consider the following factors:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The cost of acquisition of the asset, i.e., the purchase price, including expenses for the sale or transfer of the property.</li>
                    <li>The cost of any improvement made to the asset.</li>
                    <li>The total property income is treated as a deduction or reasonable expenses in the respective property.</li>
                    <li>Capital gain is the amount of sale minus the cost of acquisition, reasonable expenses, and improvements.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Calculation of Long-Term Capital Gain</h2>
                <p>There are the following factors needed to calculate long-term capital gain –</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Full consideration is the actual sale or transfer of property.</li>
                    <li>Indexed cost of acquisition and improvement.</li>
                    <li>Expenses on the transfer of asset or reasonable expenses in the respective property.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Capital gain is the amount of sale minus the indexed cost of acquisition, reasonable expenses, and improvements.</p>
                <h2>Capital Gain Tax on Property: Exemptions</h2>
                <p>There are several ways to get tax-free exemptions depending on the kind of reinvestment made after the sale of property, such as under a residential property, bonds, or agricultural property. The following sections under the Income Tax Act provide exemptions:</p>
                <h3>Tax Exemption under Section 54</h3>
                <p>Individuals need to meet the following criteria before availing an exemption under this section –</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>If an individual claims exemption on capital gain on property, deduction is allowed when the house property is purchased or constructed within the following time frame: purchase within 1 year before, or 2 years after, or construction within 3 years after, a minimum of two housing properties.</li>
                    <li>The amount of capital gain should be invested in another house within the sale consideration amount.</li>
                    <li>The maximum amount that can be invested is Rs. 2 Crore.</li>
                    <li>The amount invested should not be sold or transferred for three years after the purchase.</li>
                    <li>If an individual wants to invest in two consecutive properties at once, however, each cannot be claimed for exemption more than once in a lifetime.</li>
                    <li>Any unutilized amount should be deposited in a capital gain account scheme.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Tax Exemption under Section 54F</h3>
                <p>Exemption on capital gain on property is available, if these following parameters should be considered –</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The respective capital gain must be from the sale of any long-term capital asset other than a housing property.</li>
                    <li>Any investment of the sale must reach a total before 1 year of sale or after 2 years.</li>
                    <li>Any investment must be made in a new construction project, which needs to be completed within 3 years from the date of sale.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>To avail this exemption under capital gain tax on property on the whole amount of capital gain, an individual needs to purchase a new house or invest the amount in bonds within the sale of the asset. The exemption is available only if the new house is not sold or transferred for three years. The following calculation pattern can be used for this situation –</p>
                <p>Exempt amount = (Capital Gain × net amount invested) / net consideration amount</p>
                <h3>Tax Exemption under Section 54EC</h3>
                <p>Exemption on capital gain tax on property is available to individuals against meeting the following conditions –</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Capital gain generated from the sale of a housing property needs to be invested in specified bonds, provided by the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) or Rural Electrification Corporation (REC).</li>
                    <li>The investment amount cannot exceed Rs. 50 lakhs in the given financial year.</li>
                    <li>The amount must be invested in these bonds within 6 months from the sale date. This invested time frame is crucial to avail the exemption.</li>
                    <li>The bonds must be held for a minimum of 5 years from the date of purchase.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>In case the individual wants to invest before filing for the year, he/she can deposit the amount in a capital gain account scheme. If the amount is not utilized within the specified period, the exemption is lost, and capital gain tax is levied. The exemption is available only if the bonds are not sold or transferred for 5 years. The following calculation pattern can be used for this situation –</p>
                <p>Exempt amount = (Capital Gain × net amount invested) / net consideration amount</p>
                <h3>Tax Exemption under Section 54B</h3>
                <p>This exemption is only available on capital gain from a sale of land for an agricultural purpose outside of a rural area. A rural area can be described as –</p>
                <table class="interval-table">
                    <thead>
                        <tr><th>Location</th><th>The population of municipal corporation or cantonment board</th></tr>
                    </thead>
                    <tbody>
                        <tr><td>If a place is outside the local limit of a municipal corporation or cantonment board</td><td>More than 10 thousand and less than 1 lakh</td></tr>
                        <tr><td>If a place is outside the local limit of the corporation by 8km</td><td>More than 1 lakh and less than 10 lakh</td></tr>
                        <tr><td>If a place is outside the local limit of the corporation by 8km</td><td>More than 10 lakh</td></tr>
                    </tbody>
                </table>
                <ul>
                    <li>The exemption period needs to be availed within 2 years from the date of sale.</li>
                    <li>The capital gain needs to be invested in another agricultural land within 2 years from the date of sale.</li>
                    <li>If the new agricultural land is sold within 3 years, the exemption is lost, and capital gain tax is levied.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>It is always advisable to consult a tax expert or financial advisor to understand the best exemption for capital gain tax on property. It will help you make an informed decision and reduce your tax liability.</p>
