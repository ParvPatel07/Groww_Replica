                <h1>Short Term Capital Gain Tax on Mutual Funds</h1>
                <p>Mutual Funds are pooled investment tools that collect capital from various investors and pool them to invest in the purchase of company shares, bonds, and stocks.</p>
                <p>These funds fall under investment vehicles that are chosen by thousands of individuals and are managed by professional fund managers and account executives according to the investor's goals and risk tolerance. The funds' performance returns are monitored and tracked according to their respective benchmarks customized to suit investors.</p>
                <p>Earnings from Mutual Funds can be classified into two categories:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="#">Capital gains</a></li>
                    <li>Dividends</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Capital gain from Mutual Funds refers to the profit that is acquired by individuals who sell the total or a fraction of their shares at a price higher than the cost of acquisition. The difference between the sale and purchase price is the capital gain amount.</p>
                <p>For tax purposes in India, capital gains on Mutual Funds are taxed at the hand of investors as either short-term or long-term, depending on the holding period. The taxability of capital gains depends on the type of mutual fund, holding period, and the investor's income tax slab.</p>
                <p>Short-term capital gains depend on the taxation of types of assets. Mutual Funds are also classified as long-term or short-term depending upon the holding period. The short-term capital gain tax on mutual funds is applicable when the holding period is less than 12 months for equity-oriented funds and less than 36 months for debt-oriented funds.</p>
                <p>For the purpose of taxation, mutual funds are classified into equity mutual funds, debt mutual funds, and hybrid mutual funds. The taxability of short-term capital gains is different for each type of mutual fund.</p>
                <h2>What is Short Term Capital Gain (STCG) from Mutual Funds?</h2>
                <p>Short Term Capital Gain (STCG) from Mutual Funds is the difference between the purchase and sale price of mutual fund units, where the holding period is less than 12 months for equity-oriented funds and less than 36 months for debt-oriented funds. The taxability of STCG depends on the type of mutual fund, the holding period, and the investor's income tax slab.</p>
                <p>STCG on equity mutual funds is taxed at 15% (plus applicable cess and surcharge) if the sale is made through a recognized stock exchange and the transaction is subject to Securities Transaction Tax (STT). For other equity mutual funds, the gains are taxed as per the investor's income tax slab.</p>
                <p>STCG on debt mutual funds is added to the investor's income and taxed as per the applicable income tax slab. Hybrid mutual funds are taxed based on their composition (equity or debt) and their holding period. Following is a detailed table for the taxability of short-term capital gains on mutual funds:</p>
                <h3>Equity Mutual Funds and Their Taxability</h3>
                <p><a href="#">Equity Mutual Funds</a> are funds that invest at least 65% of their assets in shares of a listed company. These gains are classified as short-term capital gains if the holding period is less than 12 months. The tax rate is 15% (plus cess and surcharge) if the sale is made through a recognized stock exchange and is subject to STT.</p>

                <h2>Other Tax on Short-Term Capital Gains on Mutual Funds</h2>
                <p>Apart from the above-mentioned sources, note that short-term capital gains on Mutual Funds, Equity Mutual Funds, are also liable for STT or Securities Transaction Tax.</p>
                <p>This is a kind of tax that is collected at the source and is levied on every equity-oriented fund that purchases or sells securities listed under recognized stock exchanges in India. In the case of a sale of equity-oriented Mutual Funds, Securities (STT) is levied at 0.001% on the sale amount.</p>
                <p>Learning these tax implications is crucial for any individual looking to invest in short-term Mutual Funds. In case investors incur a capital loss from investing in any of these investment sources, the loss can either be set off against other capital gains or carried forward for a period of up to 8 assessment years.</p>
