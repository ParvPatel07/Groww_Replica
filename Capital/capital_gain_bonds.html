                <h1>Capital Gain Bonds</h1>
                <h2>Capital Gain Bonds (S4EC Bonds) India</h2>
                <p>Financial instruments are divided into two types – market-linked financial instruments and fixed-income financial instruments. Market-linked instruments include stocks, equity shares, equity-linked Mutual Funds, derivatives, insurance-cum-investment double benefit plans, etc. These tools depend on market fluctuations and have no fixed returns.</p>
                <p>Fixed-income instruments include government bonds, debentures, fixed deposits, and other tax-free investing debentures and bonds. Such tools have a fixed interest rate, which is decided by the issuer. These bonds are open to the financial market for a fixed tenure and are considered safe investments.</p>
                <p>Any financial instrument related to infrastructural financing is considered as a risk-free capital asset. Capital gain bonds are issued by the government and are eligible for tax exemption. In India, capital gain bonds are also known as S4EC bonds or 54EC bonds.</p>
                <h2>What are S4EC Bonds?</h2>
                <p>S4EC bonds or capital gain bonds are debt-based tax-free financial instruments, which help in exempting capital gains tax. These bonds are issued by government-backed institutions such as the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI), Rural Electrification Corporation (REC), Power Finance Corporation (PFC), and Indian Railways Finance Corporation (IRFC). The interest rate is fixed and the tenure is usually 5 years.</p>
                <h2>How does Capital Gains Bonds help in Tax Exemptions?</h2>
                <p>There are the following advantages of capital gain bonds in capital gains exemption under Section 54EC:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Investment in these bonds is eligible for exemption from capital gains tax, subject to a maximum of Rs. 50 lakh in a financial year.</li>
                    <li>The investment must be made within 6 months from the date of transfer of the original asset.</li>
                    <li>The bonds must be held for a minimum of 5 years. If sold before 5 years, the exemption is withdrawn.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>For individuals who have sold a property and made a capital gain, these are also popular options as a Public Sector Undertaking (PSU) bond. The interest earned is taxable, but the principal amount is exempt from capital gains tax if invested as per the rules. The interest rate is usually around 5% to 6% per annum. The maximum investment limit is Rs. 50 lakh per financial year. In Budget 2018, this lock-in period was increased to five years (earlier it was three years) for 54EC capital bonds.</p>
                <h2>How is Investment in Capital Gains Bonds Better than Other Investments?</h2>
                <p>An example would best explain the difference between S4EC bonds and other investment options and whether it is better to invest in such bonds, as opposed to other investment options, for long- and short-term gains below.</p>
                <p>Let's say, for 5 years, Rs.10,00,000 is invested in S4EC bonds, which offer a capital gain-linked interest rate of 5% per annum. The interest is paid annually, and the principal is repaid at maturity. The table below shows the calculation for a 5-year investment in S4EC bonds:</p>

                    </thead>

                        <tr><td>Net return after tax on maturity</td><td>Rs. 2,34,250</td><td>Varies</td></tr>

                <h2>Different Kinds of Bonds</h2>
                <p>There are different types of bonds available in the retail market:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Sovereign Bonds:</strong> These bonds are issued by the Central Government. They are also called government securities (G-Secs) and are considered the safest investment.</li>
                    <li><strong>Municipal Bonds:</strong> These bonds are issued by state governments and municipal corporations. These bonds are tax-free and are used to raise funds for infrastructure projects.</li>
                    <li><strong>Corporate Bonds:</strong> This kind of bond is also popular in the stock market; however, it does not cover as much capital gain as government bonds. Their interest rates are higher, but the risk is also higher.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>How to Make an Investment in S4EC Bonds</h2>

                <h2>Indian Financial Market</h2>
                <p>The various financial market can be sub-divided into an asset category grouped as the equity share market or FDs, or public bonds or capital gain eligible bonds. It takes a market bond issue to satisfy certain eligibility criteria for tax exemption. Another factor that adds to the lower demand for bonds linked to capital gains bonds (interest rate 5%/6%) which is less than FDs or shares.</p>
                <p>In simple terms, a Tax-Free Municipal scheme includes investing in bonds to benefit the state. However, in the long run, it is a safe investment. The interest rate is lower compared to FDs or shares, but the risk is also lower. In the case of S4EC bonds, the interest is taxable, but the principal is exempt from capital gains tax.</p>
                <h2>Bonds are dealt with in two markets – primary and secondary markets.</h2>
                <h3>Primary market</h3>
                <p>This is the first market an investor is introduced through the primary market. Any entity which regulates itself can choose to issue capital gain bonds, which enjoy tax exemption. It can be considered as being applicable for both individuals and companies, which makes them more reliable.</p>
                <h3>Secondary market</h3>
                <p>The task of exchange trading includes the risk of broker, individuals, as well as corporations, can sell their bonds in the secondary market for capital gains.</p>
                <p>Capital gain bonds are a great option for anyone looking to save on taxes paid. Through this, they also benefit from a guaranteed fixed annual return, which mitigates risk factors. It can be considered a blessing solution for both individuals and companies who wish to save more on their taxes.</p>
