                <h1>Long Term Capital Gain Tax on Shares</h1>
                <p>Capital gains tax can be divided as profits arising out of a trade or transfer of properties, whether movable or immovable. These properties can be listed shares.</p>
                <p>Capital gains tax is also classified into long-term and short-term based on the holding period of the assets, or taxable before any specified period. Shares held for more than 12 months are considered long-term capital assets, and the gains from their sale are subject to long-term capital gains tax (LTCG).</p>
                <p>Taxation usually falls under a long-term capital gain when the asset is held for more than 12 months. Popular listed securities, mutual fund securities, and other direct securities are all subject to this tax. Assets held below this period are short-term capital assets.</p>
                <h2>Taxability of Long Term Capital Gain (LTCG) on Shares</h2>
                <p>Long-term capital gain on shares is taxable, as the changes brought in the 2018 year budget. However, any change has been made in the applicable tax clause since then.</p>
                <p>Section 112A of the Income Tax Act, 1961, provides that the long-term capital gain from listed Equity Shares/Securities/Units of Equity-Oriented Funds/Business Trusts, exceeding Rs. 1 lakh in a financial year, is taxable at 10% (without indexation). The STT (Securities Transaction Tax) must be paid at the time of acquisition and transfer of such shares. The exemption for gains up to Rs. 1 lakh remains.</p>
                <h2>Tax Provision Amendments on Long-Term Capital Gains</h2>
                <p>Several amendments have been made to the tax provisions for long-term capital gains on shares, including changes in exemption limits, grandfathering provisions, and reporting requirements. The following are the key provisions:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>1. Exemption for gains up to Rs. 1 lakh per year.</li>
                    <li>2. 10% tax on gains above Rs. 1 lakh, without indexation.</li>
                    <li>3. Grandfathering of gains up to 31 January 2018.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Long Term Capital Gains Tax Exemption</h2>
                <p>Individuals can avoid long-term capital gains tax by claiming exemptions as above (Section 54F). They need to meet the following conditions:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>1. Amount is invested in a new residential construction, measured from the date of transfer, in a maximum of 2 houses in India, within 2 years of sale or within 3 years of construction.</li>
                    <li>2. Any investment of sale value in a construction project, which needs to be completed within 2 years.</li>
                    <li>3. If an individual invests in a new house, capital gain would be transferred to that individual, deductible to set the new property within 3 years of purchase.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This exclusion is for those who claim long-term capital gain on shares, however, not adjusted to its associated cost or indexed value. This is because of the introduction of "Grandfathering" which helps to recalculate taxable capital gains for applicable individuals.</p>
                <h2>Grandfathering</h2>
                <p>Grandfathering is a tax provision that allows certain individuals an exemption from changing rules. The group of people can be considered to have benefited from a tax benefit, which is not available to new investors.</p>
                <p>When grandfathering is applied, the cost of acquisition of shares is considered based on the previous long-term capital gain rules, or the fair market value as of 31 January 2018, whichever is higher. This helps to protect gains made before the new rules came into effect, ensuring that only gains made after this date are taxed significantly.</p>
                <p>When computing capital gains, the cost of acquisition for these assets is determined as follows – grandfathering provision: higher of the actual purchase price or the fair market value as of 31 January 2018, whichever is lower between the sale price and FMV.</p>
                <table class="interval-table">
                    <thead>
                        <tr><th>Particulars</th><th>Tax Implications</th></tr>
                    </thead>
                    <tbody>
                        <tr><td>Purchase of securities before 31.1.2018 and sale after 31.1.2018</td><td>Tax is only on capital gain above FMV as on 31.1.2018</td></tr>
                        <tr><td>Purchase and sale after 31.1.2018</td><td>Tax is only on capital gain above cost of acquisition</td></tr>
                    </tbody>
                </table>
                <h2>Calculation of Long term Capital Gain for Grandfathering</h2>
                <p>For the calculation of long-term capital gain in this case, the greater between FMV or the Cost of Acquisition, it can be determined by considering the following:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>The actual cost of acquisition</li>
                    <li>Fair market value (FMV) as on 31.1.2018</li>
                    <li>The sale consideration of the security</li>
                </ol>
                <p>The highest capital gain price is taken. In all cases – FMV, sale consideration – Cost of Acquisition.</p>
                <p>Suppose FMV (particular share) is Rs. 60,000, it is sold after 31.1.2018 and the sale amount is 1,20,000. Rs. 20,000. The highest value is considered, which will be Rs. 80,000.</p>
                <p>The cost of acquisition calculation is determined before calculating the LTCG on shares. The higher of –</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Actual purchase cost</li>
                    <li>FMV as on 31.1.2018</li>
                    <li>Sale value as on sale date</li>
                </ul>
                <p>From this, the cost of acquisition should be the value taken, which is Rs. 80,000 as it is below that of the FMV and sale price and higher than the cost of acquisition. Therefore, LTCG = Sale price – Rs. 80,000.</p>
                <p>So LTCG = (Rs. 120,000 – 80,000) = 40,000</p>
                <h2>Long-term Capital Loss</h2>
                <p>Long-term capital loss can be set off or carried forward by the long-term capital loss shares sold above the cost of acquisition and below the FMV. Such losses can be set off against long-term capital gains in the same year or carried forward for up to 8 years. Losses under Section 94(7), 94(8), and similar rules apply. It is important to update all gains and losses in your tax return.</p>

                <h2>Tax Filing Process Changes after Finance Bill 2018</h2>
                <p>Gain on sale (LTCG), after Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) announced relaxation of the earlier computation of cost of acquisition, is now subject to grandfathering provision.</p>
                <p>After the implementation of Finance Bill 2018, which rationalized certain grandfathered assets/taxation for long-term capital gain, individuals are required to report the sale of shares and mutual funds in their income tax return, including the cost of acquisition, FMV as on 31.1.2018, and sale value. The new rules apply to all sales made after 31.1.2018 for listed shares and mutual funds.</p>
                <p>Individuals are required to maintain proper documentation, capital gain calculation, and supporting evidence for all transactions. Losses can be set off or carried forward as per the rules.</p>
