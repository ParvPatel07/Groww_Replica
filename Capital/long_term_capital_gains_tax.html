                <h1>Long Term Capital Gains Tax</h1>
                <p>Capital gains tax is levied whenever an individual earns a profit by selling capital assets such as residential gains, vehicles, stocks, bonds, and other investments such as gold.</p>
                <p>Capital gains tax is categorized into 2 types: Short Term Capital Gains Tax and Long Term Capital Gains Tax. Transactions involving the sale of capital assets are subject to these taxes. The rules for all assets, as well as each asset they are bought/sold, may be applicable as per the tax rules in India.</p>
                <p>Long-term capital gains tax is applicable on the sale/transfer of properties, securities, equity, and assets that are held for more than a specified period. Assets such as property, Gold and Mutual Funds, Equity Shares, Government Securities, UTI, Zero Coupon Bonds, etc., are all subject to this tax.</p>
                <p>In India, the holding period for calculation of LTCG tax is made either 12 months or 36 months of ownership (depending on the type of asset).</p>
                <h2>Calculation of LTCG Tax</h2>
                <p>For an individual to calculate Long Term Capital Gains (LTCG) tax, the tax is charged on the profit gained from the sale of a capital asset held for a long term.</p>
                <p>In India, for equity shares, the LTCG tax is 10% on gains exceeding Rs. 1 lakh in a financial year, without the benefit of indexation. For other assets, such as real estate, gold, debt mutual funds, etc., the LTCG tax is 20% with indexation.</p>
                <p>In the case of mutual funds, the long-term capital gains tax is calculated as 20% for property/gold/debt funds, or 10% for equity shares, as per the rules. The calculation is based on the indexed cost of acquisition, which adjusts the purchase price for inflation.</p>
                <h3>Example: Calculation of LTCG</h3>
                <p>Suppose you bought a property for Rs. 20 lakh in 2005. By 2018, you sold it for Rs. 80 lakh. The cost was already adjusted for inflation using the Cost Inflation Index (CII). The CII for 2005-06 was 117, and for 2018-19 was 280.</p>
                <p>Formula to calculate LTCG: LTCG = Sale Proceeds – Indexed acquisition amount – other related expenses</p>
                <div style="background:#f8f9fa;border-left:4px solid #00d09c;padding:1rem 1.5rem;margin:1rem 0 1.5rem 0;">
                    Indexed acquisition amount = (Original purchase price × CII of year of sale) ÷ CII of year of purchase<br>
                    = (20,00,000 × 280) ÷ 117 = Rs. 47,86,324
                </div>
                <p>From the above example, this would be: Rs. 80 lakh (minus) Rs. 47.86 lakh = Rs. 32.14 lakh</p>
                <p>Previous LTCG Tax (10% Exemption, i.e., Rs. 1 lakh) - Regulation before Union Budget 2018</p>
                <div style="background:#f8f9fa;border-left:4px solid #00d09c;padding:1rem 1.5rem;margin:1rem 0 1.5rem 0;">
                    Rs. 32,14,000 – Rs. 1,00,000 (exemption) = Rs. 31,14,000 × 10% = Rs. 3,14,400
                </div>
                <p>New LTCG Tax (Rs. 1 lakh Exemption, 10% + 20% with indexation) - Regulation After Union Budget 2018</p>
                <div style="background:#f8f9fa;border-left:4px solid #00d09c;padding:1rem 1.5rem;margin:1rem 0 1.5rem 0;">
                    Rs. 32,14,000 – Rs. 1,00,000 (exemption) = Rs. 31,14,000 × 10% = Rs. 3,14,400<br>
                    Rs. 32,14,000 × 20% (with indexation) = Rs. 6,42,800
                </div>
                <h2>Tax on Long-term Capital Gain</h2>
                <p>In India, capital gains tax on sale of eligible shares/other securities is 10% on gains above Rs. 1 lakh, and 20% on other long-term capital assets, such as property, gold, debt funds, etc. The table below summarizes the applicable LTCG tax rates:</p>

                <h3>Saving Tax on Long-term Capital Gain</h3>
                <p>Here are a few detailed tax-saving strategies for long-term capital gain:</p>
                <h4>Investing in Residential Property</h4>
                <p>One can avail exemption from capital gains by investing property in specified long-term capital gains. These exemptions are available under Section 54 and Section 54F of the Income Tax Act, 1961.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Section 54:</b> An individual or Hindu Undivided Family will be exempted from paying long-term capital gains if the capital gain is used to purchase a new capital gain for purchase or construction of new residential property.</li>
                    <li><b>Section 54F:</b> In this section, all sale-related or consideration funds must be invested in buying only one capital asset, other than a residential property, and the property amount must be purchased within the property selling timeline for long-term capital gain exemption. The property must also be allowed to be bought only once after making an indexation.</li>
                    <li><b>Section 54EC:</b> Under this section, an individual or a Hindu Undivided Family can also avail exemption under long-term capital gain, provided the capital gain is used to purchase or build a bond. The sale capital gain will be exempted from tax.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Investing in Bonds - Section 54EC</h4>
                <p>As noted in the Section 54EC, an individual can save tax on capital gains by transferring this amount to acquire specified bonds such as NHAI and REC.</p>
                <p>The list of these bonds is available on the official website of Income Tax Department of India.</p>
                <table class="interval-table">

                        <tr><th>You May Also Be Interested to Know</th><th></th></tr>

                    </tbody>
                </table>
                <h4>Capital Gain Account Scheme</h4>
                <p>A special account that allows an individual to access the tax exemptions without purchasing a residential property. This account is provided by banks and is used to deposit the amount of capital gains, which is eligible for exemption.</p>
                <p>For withdrawal over the threshold, the fund must be utilized within 3 years of withdrawal.</p>
                <p>If the amount is not utilized within the specified period, the exemption on capital gain tax is lost, and capital gain tax is levied.</p>
                <p>This long-term capital gains tax was introduced with the introduction of the Union Budget of 2018. Every individual is required to pay this tax as per the rules.</p>
