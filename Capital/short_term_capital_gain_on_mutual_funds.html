                <h1>Short-Term Capital Gain on Mutual Funds</h1>
                <p>Mutual Funds are an investment instrument where funds are invested in shares and other different sources to generate lucrative returns. These can be via financial institutions, companies, and individuals. Savings investors can also invest in share markets.</p>
                <p>The market generates income in two forms â€“ dividends and capital gains.</p>
                <p>Dividends are profits earned and disbursed periodically to the investor as long as the Mutual Funds belong to him/her.</p>
                <p>Capital gain is the profit earned when you sell your mutual fund units at a price higher than what you paid. This gain is also part of the difference between the cost of acquisition and selling price. Please refer to classification and explanation as depicted below (and depending on the asset, your holding period, and tax rules):</p>
                <p>Short-term gain refers to gains on funds held for a shorter period, while long-term capital gain on Mutual Funds is for funds held for a longer period.</p>
                <h2>Types of Capital Gains and Mutual Funds</h2>
                <p>The classification of capital gains depends on the holding period of the asset/security. It represents length of time for which security or asset is held. Funds are classified as equity-oriented, debt-oriented, balanced, and others. Each has its own rules for short-term and long-term capital gains.</p>
                <p>The different kinds of Mutual Funds and their respective STCG implications:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Equity Funds:</strong> These are funds that invest in shares of listed companies. If held for less than 12 months, capital gains are considered short-term and taxed accordingly. If held for more than 12 months, they are long-term capital gains.</li>
                    <li><strong>Debt Funds:</strong> These funds invest in fixed income securities like bonds, government securities, etc. If held for less than 36 months, capital gains are short-term; more than 36 months, they are long-term.</li>
                    <li><strong>Balanced Funds:</strong> These funds invest in both equity and debt instruments. The holding period for classification depends on the fund's composition.</li>
                    <li><strong>Unlisted Equity Funds:</strong> These are equity funds not listed on recognized stock exchanges. Their holding period for short-term/long-term classification may differ.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The following table summarizes the holding period for Mutual Funds:</p>

                <h2>Short-Term Capital Gain on Mutual Funds: Tax Implications</h2>
                <p>Taxation on short-term capital gains is imposed on profits earned from mutual funds, depending on the asset's nature and holding period. The applicable tax rate depends on the type of mutual fund and the investor's income slab, with some understanding of special circumstances:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Equity Funds:</strong> Short-term capital gains on equity funds, which are sold under recognized stock exchanges are taxed according to Section 111A (15%). This is after deduction of Securities Transaction Tax (STT) that gets charged when buying/selling stocks, or during the purchase or sale of units. On the other hand, STCG is also charged at slab rates for unlisted equity funds.</li>
                    <li><strong>Debt-oriented/balanced funds:</strong> If the holding period is less than 36 months, the gain amount is added to the individual's income and taxed as per the applicable slab. For balanced funds, the holding period is 12 or 36 months, depending on the fund's composition. Debt-oriented funds are taxed as per the slab rate.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Suppose an individual buys units for 50,000 and sells them for 70,000 within a year; short-term capital gain for the year 2024 is 19,000. The tax is 15% of 19,000, which is 2,850.</p>
                <p>The tax for primary amounts is 15% as STCG. Therefore, the slab is also 15% (with cess &amp; surcharge), which is 2,850.</p>
                <ol start="3">
                    <li><strong>Equity-oriented hybrid funds:</strong> The maximum share of these funds is equity. Holding period is 12 months, and they are taxed according to Section 111A like short-term capital gain on equity mutual funds.</li>
                    <li><strong>Debt-oriented balanced funds:</strong> These funds comprise majority of debt instruments in their structure; thus, these funds do not attract Section 111A for taxation purposes. Short-term capital gain on such Mutual Funds of this nature is added to the investor's income and taxed as per the applicable slab rate.</li>
                    <li><strong>Balanced funds:</strong> Standard funds which comprise both 65% of equity, stocks, and/or selected schemes. Therefore, these funds are taxed at 15% as per Section 111A.</li>
                    <li><strong>Unlisted equity funds:</strong> STCG on unlisted funds: This includes units not compliant with Section 111A, i.e., which are not listed on a recognized stock exchange. Gains are taxed as per the individual's slab rate, and no STT is paid. NRIs are also taxed at 15% + cess and surcharge, unless covered under slab rate.</li>
                </ol>

                <h2>Short-term Capital Loss</h2>
                <p>In case a security is sold for a price lower than the cost of acquisition (also depreciation), it is considered as a short-term capital loss.</p>
                <p>Short-term capital losses can be set off against short-term capital gains on Mutual Funds, STCGs on other investments, and even long-term capital gains. The amount of short-term capital loss carried forward can be set off against any capital gains in the next 8 assessment years. These losses can be claimed and reported in the right assessment year.</p>
                <p>Short-term capital gain on Mutual Funds is thus efficient compared to long-term capital gains. Finance Ministry recommends considering applicable STT and STCG on mutual funds, if the security has been held for more than 12 months.</p>
