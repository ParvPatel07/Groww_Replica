                <h1>Short Term Capital Gain on Shares</h1>
                <p>A capital gain can be achieved when selling an asset. It can be either long-term or short-term capital gain. Specifically, a seller needs to adhere to the short-term capital gain conditions when he/she sells shares or stocks before the prescribed period.</p>
                <h2>What is Short Term Capital Gain on Shares?</h2>
                <p>Short-term holding of shares or stocks that have been held for up to 12 months is classified as Short-Term Capital Gain (STCG). The holding period is the time between the date of acquisition and the date of sale. Short-Term Capital Gain is taxed at a different rate than Long-Term Capital Gain.</p>
                <p>In order to define STCG on shares or stocks, the gains earned through them can be split into 2 categories, namely:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>STCG under Section 111A</li>
                    <li>STCG Not under Section 111A</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>STCG under Section 111A</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>A rate of 15% shall be charged on shares or stocks when capital gains fall under this tax rate category. They must be listed and recognized on a stock exchange.</li>
                    <li>Gains generated through the sale of equity shares listed on a recognized stock exchange.</li>
                    <li>Gains generated through the sale of equity-oriented mutual funds listed on a recognized stock exchange.</li>
                    <li>Gains generated through the sale of units of business trusts listed on a recognized stock exchange.</li>
                    <li>Gains generated through bonds, debentures, and Government securities.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>For example:</p>
                <p>Mr. A is a salaried employee who purchased shares and later sold them for Rs. 4,40,000.</p>
                <p>He decides to sell his stocks, which he had held for less than 12 months.</p>
                <p>Since short-term capital gains are subject to a flat 15% tax rate, Mr. A will be taxed under Section 111A, if all necessary tax is paid while applicable conditions are met.</p>
                <p>We suggest it is always advisable to consult with tax professionals, as well as based on the detailed income and tax structure, to help you make the most of the exemptions and deductions available for short-term capital gains on shares.</p>
                <h3>STCG Not under Section 111A</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Short-term capital gains on shares not covered under Section 111A are taxed at the individual's applicable income tax slab rate.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Calculation of Short-Term Capital Gain on Shares</h2>
                <p>Calculation of short-term capital gain on shares is quite simple. The gain is computed by deducting the share's original cost from its actual selling price.</p>
                <p>Here is an example where shares gain capital on sale and are sold within 12 months of purchase for Rs. 1,00,000 but shares at Rs. 80,000. The gain is Rs. 20,000. The tax rate is 15% under Section 111A for listed shares.</p>
                <p><b>Sale Price:</b> Rs. 1,00,000<br><b>Purchase Price:</b> Rs. 80,000<br><b>STCG:</b> Rs. 20,000<br><b>Tax:</b> 15% of Rs. 20,000 = Rs. 3,000</p>
                <h2>How to Calculate Short Term Capital Gain on Assets?</h2>
                <p>STCG on shares can be calculated with the help of the formula mentioned below –</p>
                <p>STCG = Sale value of asset – (cost of acquisition + expenses incurred in the course of transaction + cost of asset improvement)</p>
                <p>In case of all classes of short-term capital gains on equity shares, cost of asset improvement is not applicable. However, individuals should learn about other parameters in this formula because for calculating short capital gains, the formula is as follows:</p>
                <h3>Sale Value</h3>
                <p>The total value of consideration for sale value of an asset is the amount an assessee receives on the sale of the asset, a share, or a stock. It is the actual value of sale, and is subject to transaction charges, brokerage, and Securities Transaction Tax.</p>
                <p>Stock exchange = Sale value of asset – (brokerage charges + Securities Transaction Tax)</p>
                <h3>Cost of Asset Acquisition</h3>
                <p>For any short-term equity shares purchased before 1st February 2018, the calculation of the cost of acquisition is as follows:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Fetch the market value of the asset on its opening. This is done by multiplying the number of units of shares purchased with their highest price on the date (as per January 2018).</li>
                    <li>The cost of asset includes, compared to the actual cost of acquisition, and a lower value between actual and the cost.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Now, the relevant value (compared to the actual cost) is compared to the actual, and a lower value between the two is taken.</p>
                <p>This is the cost of asset acquisition. This is the only basis parameter to be followed before 1st January 2018, as the higher value of all the equity shares at the time immediately preceding this formula is considered as the cost of acquisition for the same.</p>
                <h3>Cost of Asset Improvement</h3>
                <p>Improvement of asset refers to the amount spent on any modification of the asset. This can include repair costs, renovations, or any other expenses that enhance the value of the asset. This value is not applicable to the calculation of STCG for equity shares, but is relevant for other assets.</p>
                <h3>Expenses Incurred in Due Course of Transfer or Sale</h3>
                <p>This component can include registration, brokerage/commission fee, associated charges incurred in the course of transfer or sale of shares, legal and agency charges, Securities Transaction Tax, and other applicable fees during the sale of shares, these are all deductible from the sale value.</p>
                <p>Apart from that, short-term capital gains on shares are also subject to deduction available in specific types of assets. For example, if the shares are held as business assets, the gain will be taxed as business income and not as capital gains. The period of holding, nature of the asset, and the applicable tax rate will determine the applicable tax rate and calculation method.</p>
                <p>It is always advisable to take the previous value when gains and prices are adjusted according to market inflation. Think about the tax rules and the liability on sales in the short-term capital gain on shares.</p>
