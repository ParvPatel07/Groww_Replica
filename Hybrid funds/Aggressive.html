                <h1>Aggressive Funds</h1>
                <p>Hybrid Funds work in the gray area between pure equity and pure debt funds. There are many ways to create a hybrid asset allocation. To deal with the ambiguity of asset allocation, SEBI created a category of hybrid funds and laid out guidelines to clarify the same. Hybrid funds started to appear and they include Equity Savings, Aggressive Hybrid, Balanced Hybrid, Conservative Hybrid, and Dynamic Asset Allocation. Hybrid Funds are basically for investors who want to have some exposure to equities, but with less volatility. These funds are suitable for investors who want to diversify their portfolio and reduce risk. Let's dive deep into each category of hybrid funds.</p>
                <p>Today, we will explore the Aggressive Mutual Funds and talk about some important things that you need to know about them.</p>

                <h2>What are Aggressive Funds?</h2>
                <p>Aggressive Mutual Funds are hybrid funds that invest between 60%-80% of their total assets in equity and equity-related instruments and the balance in debt securities and money market instruments. Usually, hybrid funds invest in both equity and debt instruments. But, Aggressive Hybrid Funds have a higher exposure to equity than other hybrid funds.</p>
                <p>Unlike Arbitrage funds where profit is earned by buying a security in one market at a lower price and selling it in another market at a higher price, the aim is to earn profit from investment.</p>
                <p>Aggressive Hybrid Funds allocate majority of their investments in equity. The fund managers then balance the portfolio by investing in debt and money market instruments. However, the fund manager can opt to follow the growth or value investment strategy. In this category, the fund manager balances the portfolio to reduce risk and provide stable returns. These funds are suitable for investors who want to invest for a long-term period.</p>
