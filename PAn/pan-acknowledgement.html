                <section class="blog-section">
                    <p>The PAN card acknowledgement number is given to a person when they apply for a PAN card through NSDL, UTI, or eMudra. A 15-digit acknowledgement number is provided, which helps in tracking the status of the PAN application. NSDL, UTI, and eMudra applicants can check the status of their PAN application using this number. Public can also print/download the PAN card using this acknowledgement number.</p>
                    <p>This number is vital for status verification, digital download, and for payment. If the applicant's details differ, you can use the acknowledgement number to check the status, download the e-PAN, or re-issue a card. Lost or stolen cards can also be tracked with this number.</p>
