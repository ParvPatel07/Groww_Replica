                <h1>What are Growth Stocks?</h1>
                <p>Growth stocks are Investment securities issued by companies that are in their nascent stages of development and show immense potential for growth over time. Investing in a growth stock can derive massive wealth creation for Investors through capital appreciation.</p>
                <p>However, growth stocks carry a high risk for Investment, due to the developing nature of an issuing company.</p>

                <h2>Features</h2>
                <p>Purchasing a growth stock is ideal for enterprising Individuals looking to gain massive returns on their total Investment amount. Investors can easily identify the best growth stocks and their Issuing companies by considering the following factors:</p>

                <h3>Price-to-earnings ratio</h3>
                <p>Companies having a high potential for development are Identified in the market, and shares of the same have a high Price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. Growth stocks by these companies have a high price to earnings (P/E) ratio, Indicating high returns against Investment.</p>
                <p>A high price to earnings ratio Indicates people's recognition of the total potential of a company, expecting it to grow substantially. Investors can ascertain expected returns using the following formula:</p>
                <p><strong>P/E ratio = Market value of share / Company's per share</strong></p>
                <p>However, In certain cases, a high P/E ratio can be misleading, as It might Indicate that a business is overvalued rather than Its productive capacity. Performance of such businesses is a result of boom or persistent Inflation in an economy, thereby inflating the share prices.</p>
                <p>A preliminary requisite of best growth stocks in India is that they tend to have a ratio higher than or equal to 1.</p>

                <h3>Price-earnings to growth ratio (PEG)</h3>
                <p>Due to specific limitations of the P/E ratio, Investors also look Into price-earnings to growth ratio while distinguishing growth shares in India from a standard equity share. The main Advantage of PEG ratio over P/E ratio is that It provides the Investor with a more precise estimate of expected earnings of a company.</p>
                <p><strong>PEG ratio = Market value of unit shares / Earnings to growth share ratio</strong></p>
                <p>A high PEG ratio Indicates exceptional performance demonstrated by a business. It is a better analysis tool when compared to the P/E ratio as It does not produce misleading results.</p>

                <h3>Strength of issuing business</h3>
                <p>Growth stocks can only be Issued by companies having massive potential for growth and expansion in the future. This can only be achieved if a company has a strong foundation, with a solid business development plan and Increasing profitability, productivity, and capital base.</p>
                <p>It can be demonstrated through the return on equity (ROE) value published annually. Companies raising capital through Investment In growth stocks in India may receive a return on total equity of 15% or higher annually.</p>

                <h2>Why Should You Invest in Growth Stocks?</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Higher Returns</strong></li>
                </ul>
                <p>Investment in such growth stocks is undertaken to achieve wealth accumulation through large capital gains. Such companies exhibit a higher growth rate than the Industry they are operating In, thereby producing larger revenue generated.</p>
                <p>However, Investment In growth stocks can only be realised In the long term. Any capital gains earned in this venture is subjected to long-term capital gain tax (LTCG), which is at a relatively lower than short term taxation policy. Also, to promote wealth generation in general, reducing the tax burden of Individuals even further.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Higher capital gain</strong></li>
                </ul>
                <p>Returns on best growth stocks are considerably higher than the prevailing Inflation rate in an economy, thereby allowing Investors to generate real Income on total Investments. The purchasing power of Individuals rises in the event of a higher Inflation rate, thereby also allowing Investors to gain a higher capital Income.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Lower commission charges</strong></li>
                </ul>
                <p>Growth stocks are considerably lower in cost than other stock market Investment options such as standard stocks or blue-chip stocks. Their prices are susceptible to price fluctuations and depend upon the demand for shares in the stock market, and is a key factor for Investors looking to generate capital gains in the short run. The cost of such stock is also dependent on the market value of the company and its future growth potential.</p>

                <h2>Risks Associated with Growth Stocks</h2>
                <p>Growth stocks are characterised as a risky Investment venture. This is because these companies are yet to generate profits by gaining significant market advantage, through aggressive business strategies. Such companies tend to be unpredictable in their performance and can incur significant losses in the event of adverse market fluctuations.</p>
                <p>In case a business churns out losses In the long run, Investors stand to lose on total Investment undertaken, as no dividend payments are realised during the Investment period.</p>
                <p>Growth stocks are generally Issued by companies that are of medium size and above and is highly susceptible to volatility. They are also extremely responsive to market fluctuations, due to their volatility. Even though this feature allows Investors to churn out massive returns during a market boom, Investors might also incur losses during market fluctuations. Therefore, Investors in growth stocks should understand their risks and Invest their capital.</p>
                <p>The underlying performance of growth stocks can also be a result of the persistent economic condition in a country. Unless the Issuing company possesses a strong financial fortitude, It would not be able to outperform beyond their potential. Such growth can be misleading, as It is based on an economic abnormality.</p>
                <p>Therefore, Investment in growth shares in India requires a comprehensive analysis of both chosen companies and the economic scenario, for Investors to ensure the generation of profits.</p>

                <h2>Alternative Investment Option</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Value stocks -</strong></li>
                </ul>
                <p>As opposed to growth stocks, value shares are Issued by companies currently undervalued in the market. These shares have a lower price to earnings and price to book ratio, proving to be a profitable Investment venture for Investors.</p>
                <p>Investors can gain through both dividends and capital appreciation from value stocks. Also, since value stocks are generally Issued by companies having a considerable market capitalisation, chance of attaining profitability and growth is higher for value stocks.</p>
