                <h1>National Stock Exchange of India</h1>

                <p>The National Stock Exchange of India Ltd. (NSE) is the leading stock exchange in India, headquartered in Mumbai. It was incorporated in 1992 and, since then, has evolved into an advanced, automated, electronic system for trading, making it the first of its kind in the country.</p>
                <p>In 2021, this exchange system ranked fourth in the world according to the volume of its trading activities.</p>

                <h2>What is NSE?</h2>
                <p>NSE was formed in 1992, based on the operations of the behest of the Indian government to bring transparency to the Indian stock market. NSE has a fully integrated business model comprising exchange listings, market regulation, and settlement services. NSE has contributed significantly to developing and shaping India's capital markets by introducing electronic trading and other reforms.</p>
                <p>It was also the first stock exchange in the country to introduce electronic trading facilities. This transformation brought transparency throughout the country from a single hour.</p>
                <p>As of April 30, 2023, the market capitalization of NSE is approximately USD 3.05 Trillion, putting it in 10th place on the list of the largest stock exchanges in the world.</p>
                <p>However, unlike the USA, where trading from the corporate accounts for about 70% of the country's GDP, in India, about 85% of wealth is held in real estate. As a result, the per capita investments in stocks are lower, with about 4000 among those trading in Indian stock exchanges. Thus, more electronic trading accounts should be created to increase trading activities.</p>

                <h2>Functions of NSE</h2>
                <p>The NSE was established with the specific objective of performing the following functions:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Creating a nationwide trading establishment for equities, debt, and hybrid instruments.</li>
                    <li>Ensuring easy access to investors across the country via a good communication network.</li>
                    <li>Laying down transparent and fair rules for trading, ensuring equal opportunities for all participants.</li>
                    <li>Providing a market for borrowing by the central and state governments and other entities.</li>
                    <li>Creating faster settlement cycles, book-entry settlements systems, and fulfilling the latest international norms of securities trading.</li>
</ul>

                <h2>Features of NSE</h2>
                <p>Unlike many other major stock exchanges, the NSE operates on an order-driven rather than a quote-driven market. Consequently, it uses a completely automated survey-based trading system called the National Exchange for Automated Trading (NEAT).</p>
                <p>Each order received by NEAT is assigned a unique number. If a match isn't found instantly, it is included in an order book, which is accessible to the entire market. All orders are recorded and displayed publicly, ensuring full transparency.</p>
                <p>When orders are submitted into the system, the order with the best value is most important, and the oldest order precedes orders of the same price.</p>
                <p>Order matching is accomplished by comparing the most suitable buy order, which has the most favorable price, with the most suitable sell order, which has the least favorable price. If multiple orders have the same best price, the oldest order takes priority. While automated systems create a glitch, the glitches always happen regarding all of the orders, not just one. Therefore, NEAT provides equal opportunities for all participants.</p>

                <h2>Market Segments of National Stock Exchange</h2>
                <p>NSE includes securities in Wholesale Debt Market and Capital Market Segments.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Wholesale Debt Market Division</b></li>
                </ul>
                <p>The first section is the Wholesale Debt Market section, which offers traders a trading system for diverse fixed income instruments, such as central government securities, treasury bills, state development loans, bonds, debentures, and other securities falling within this category.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>The Capital Market Division</b></li>
</ul>
                <p>The second section of the capital market offers traders a market for trading in various instruments, including equities, equity shares, exchange-traded funds, participatory notes, and retail government securities.</p>

                <h2>How Does NSE Stock Exchange Work?</h2>
                <p>Trading through this stock exchange in India is performed through an electronic order-driven system, where orders are matched based on price and time priority. The system is fully automated and ensures transparency in trading activities. Investors and traders can access the market through registered stockbrokers and trading platforms.</p>
                <p>When investors place a market order, it is automatically matched with a sell order. Thus, sellers and buyers can easily find counter-parties for their trades.</p>
                <p>Additionally, an order-driven market offers investors more transparency by displaying every buy and sell order in the market. This allows investors to see the current demand and supply for a stock and make informed trading decisions.</p>
                <p>Investors can also place limit orders, which allow them to buy or sell a stock at a specific price. This helps investors control their entry and exit prices and manage their risk.</p>
                <p>Trading on the NSE is done through a dematerialized account (demat account), which holds securities in electronic form. Investors also need a trading account to place buy and sell orders.</p>

                <h2>Trading Hours</h2>
                <p>The Capital Market segment of the NSE is open for trading on weekdays, except on Saturdays, Sundays, and other holidays declared by the stock exchange. The timing is as follows:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Pre-opening Session:</b></li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    <li>Order entry starts at 9:00 hours.</li>
                    <li>Order entry closes at 9:08 hours.</li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Regular Session:</b></li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    <li>The market opens at 9:15 hours.</li>
                    <li>The market closes at 15:30 hours.</li>
</ul>
                <p>National Stock Exchange's flagship index is the Nifty 50, which represents about 62% of the total quantum of market capitalization of the stocks listed on the NSE, and primarily is for 50 stocks of the underlying economy sectors.</p>
                <p>Currently, the stock exchange's management is handled by Corporate CEO and Managing Director and Ashish Chauhan as the Chairman of the Board of Directors.</p>
