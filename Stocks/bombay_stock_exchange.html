                <h1>Bombay Stock Exchange</h1>

                <p>The Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) is the oldest stock exchange in India, as well as Asia. Bombay Stock Exchange was established by Premchand Roychand in 1875 and is currently headed by Shri Sunderaraman Ramamurthy (Managing Director & CEO).</p>

                <h2>What is Bombay Stock Exchange?</h2>
                <p>The Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) is one of the largest securities markets. It is located on Dalal Street, Mumbai and lists over 5000 companies.</p>
                <p>BSE has contributed significantly to developing and shaping India's capital markets. Through BSE, investors can get the opportunity to trade in equities, mutual funds, debt instruments, etc.</p>
                <p>It also offers market related services including data dissemination, education, risk management, clearing, settlement, and many more.</p>

                <h2>How Does BSE Work?</h2>
                <p>Financial transactions in BSE are done online through an electronic trading system. Market orders can be directly placed through the BSE online trading system. This system operates during specific trading hours and facilitates the execution of each order when it is matched with a corresponding order from the opposite side of the transaction.</p>
                <p>Trading in the BSE share market has to be done through a brokerage agency against a stipulated charge. However, there are platforms that provide direct trading access for users, such as the BSE trading platform. The BSE trading platform is called BOLT (BSE Online Trading System). BOLT trading platform is used by this stock exchange for online share trading.</p>
                <p>Transactions made in BSE online are done through a T+2 rolling settlement, wherein all transactions are processed within two days. The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) is responsible for the regulation of the stock market. It monitors all trading activities and ensures fair practices.</p>

                <h2>Background of BSE</h2>
                <p>BSE has an interesting history. In the 19th century, some traders, with businessman Premchand Roychand, would gather under a Banyan tree in current Dalal Street. Popularly known as the Native Share and Stock Brokers Association, this gathering would exchange information regarding stocks. This eventually led to the establishment of the BSE.</p>
                <p>Earlier, the BSE worked on a floor trading system, in which a ring of brokers would shout out prices and make deals. This system was replaced by an electronic trading system called BOLT (BSE Online Trading System) in 1995. This transformation made trading faster and more efficient. In 1992, SEBI was established as the regulator of the stock market.</p>
                <p>Since then, BSE has continued to upgrade its trading system and infrastructure. In 2016, BSE launched a new trading platform called BSE Star MF for mutual funds. This platform allows investors to buy and sell mutual funds online.</p>
                <p>BSE is the first stock exchange in India to get listed. It was listed on its own platform in 2017.</p>

                <h2>Advantages Of Listing on BSE</h2>

                <ul>
                    <li><b>Legal Compliance</b></li>
                </ul>

                    <li><b>Timely Information Display</b></li>
                </ul>

                <ul>
                    <li><b>Collateral Guarantee</b></li>
                </ul>

                <h2>What are The Various Investment Methods?</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Trading of securities of a company listed on the Bombay Stock Exchange can be done either directly or indirectly, depending upon the volume of transactions undertaken.</li>
                    <li>Primary trading can be done only by registered brokerage agencies and institutional investors making bulk transactions in BSE.</li>
                    <li>Retail customers, on the other hand, do not have access to direct investment schemes and have to make transactions through a certified stockbroker or a stock investing platform. This is known as a secondary trading mechanism, regulated by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA).</li>
                    <li>For secondary trading, an individual must hold a Demat account, through which the financial transactions take place. Virtual ownership of all stocks can be gained through the account itself.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Chief Investment Segments</h2>
                <p>All companies listed under BSE can use the following financial instruments to raise funds for their business:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Equity</b></li>
                </ul>
                <p>Equity instruments primarily consist of shares issued by a company to raise adequate paid-up capital for its smooth operations. Massive equity is raised during an initial public offering of a start-up company in the primary capital market. However, new issuance of shares is subject to strict regulations under SEBI due to the volatility of prices at this stage.</p>
                <p>Equity already issued can be traded amongst retail customers in the secondary market through a stockbroker.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Debt Instruments and Government Securities</b></li>
                </ul>
                <p>These tools are issued by an underlying company to raise finances without giving ownership to investors. Relatively risk-free in nature, trading in debt instruments can be done in both primary and secondary markets, depending upon its nature.</p>
                <p>Various government securities such as zero coupon bonds, floating rate bonds, capital indexed bonds and dated securities are traded in BSE.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Major Indices</b></li>
                </ul>
                <p>Sensex is a benchmark index under BSE. It is a free-floating market-weighted index tracking the performance of the top 30 companies.</p>
                <p>BSE share market uses Sensex to monitor the performance of these companies to determine whether the capital market of India would rise or fall, depending upon the movement of share prices of these companies.</p>
                <p>Other than the benchmark index, several other sectoral indices are also provided by BSE, such as:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>S&P BSE Auto</li>
                    <li>S&P BSE Bankex</li>
                    <li>S&P BSE Capital Goods</li>
                    <li>S&P BSE Consumer Durables</li>
                    <li>S&P BSE Fast-Moving Consumer Goods</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Indices aggregating companies on the basis of market capitalisation into small and mid-cap companies are also launched by BSE, in the form of BSE small-cap index and BSE mid-cap index. These indices can be tracked by index Mutual Funds aiming to profit from capital appreciation of stocks of these companies.</p>
                <p>Bombay Stock Exchange plays a vital role in regulating the financial markets of India. Market fluctuations in an economy can easily be observed through the performance of its benchmark index, which has cascading effects on the capital sector of economies all around the world.</p>
