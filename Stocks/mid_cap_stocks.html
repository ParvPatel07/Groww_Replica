                <h1> Mid-Cap Stocks?</h1>
                <p>The classification of respective company's stocks depends on its market capitalization. Such classification is volatile and can change with the change in a company's market valuation.</p>
                <h2>What are Mid-Cap Stocks?</h2>
                <p>Mid-cap is an appropriate term that encapsulates companies and stocks which fall in between large-cap and small-cap stocks.</p>
                <p>Understanding market capitalization is needed with the help of a company's outstanding number of shares and the value of each share.</p>
                <p>The following table demonstrates large-cap, mid-cap, and small-cap companies as per their market valuation:</p>
                <table>
                    <thead>
                        <tr>
                            <th>Large-cap companies</th>
                            <th>Mid-cap companies</th>
                            <th>Small-cap companies</th>
                        </tr>
                    </thead>
                    <tbody>
                        <tr>
                            <td>Market Capitalisation above Rs. 20,000 Crore</td>
                            <td>Market Capitalisation in between Rs. 5,000 - 20,000 Crore</td>
                            <td>Market Capitalisation below Rs. 5,000 Crore</td>
                        </tr>
                    </tbody>
                </table>
                <p>However, the classification is also subject to an update annually. In the Indian stock market, mid-cap companies are the ones with market capitalization between Rs. 5000 crore and Rs. 20,000 crore. NIFTY indices are generally composed of mid-cap companies. Nifty also has a benchmark mid-cap index in India called the Nifty Midcap 50 which hosts the top 50 mid-cap companies listed on the National Stock Exchange.</p>
                <h2>What are its Features?</h2>
                <p>Some of the crucial features of these stocks are discussed below -</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Diversity:</strong> Mid-cap shares lie on a broad spectrum, bordering both small-cap and large-cap stocks. These shares carry a mix of risks and rewards associated with mid-cap companies might be growing faster than large-caps, while also being more stable than small-caps. Many mid-caps have recently graduated from small-cap and therefore show greater growth potential to stability.</li>
                    <li><strong>Chance of growth:</strong> One of the most appealing characteristics of the stocks owned by mid-cap companies. In most cases, mid-caps are established companies with strong business models. Therefore, mid-cap companies can expect much continuous growth to become an overnight success during bullish market or market expansion, which will increase mid-cap share price accordingly.</li>
                    <li><strong>Moderate risk:</strong> Compared to small-cap stocks, these stocks respond with lesser intensity to market volatility. However, in comparison to large-cap stocks, they offer less stability during market contraction or a bearish market.</li>
                    <li><strong>Liquid:</strong> Mid-cap stocks are relatively liquid compared to small-cap stocks. Companies with such stocks are well-known, and investors can invest their shares. Therefore, it becomes easier to find buyers during a sale at a fair price.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Why Should You Invest in Mid-Cap Stocks?</h2>
                <p>In the past two years, mid-cap stocks have performed significantly better than both large-cap stocks and small-cap stocks.</p>
                <p>These stocks offer an analogous potential as penny stocks, where one may expect the best of both worlds, i.e., risk mitigation and substantial returns. They have become a favourite of seasoned investors. They are all expecting an investment in them.</p>
                <p>Investing in your portfolio has significant advantages which are discussed in the points below -</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Lesser risk:</strong> Mid-cap stocks are less volatile and offer a perfect mix of both debt and equities. It directly allows investors to diversify their portfolio to spread risk and avail assured returns.</li>
                    <li><strong>Rate of growth:</strong> Given that most mid-cap companies are positioned in the middle of the growth graph, they have room for value appreciation and also for substantial dividends too.</li>
                    <li><strong>Less exposed:</strong> Mid-cap stocks are not as exposed to the inefficiencies of the market as small-cap stocks. Moreover, mid-cap companies are not influenced by large financial institutions. This minimizes price volatility during bearish market.</li>
                    <li><strong>Considerable information:</strong> unlike smallcap companies, companies with these stocks provide enough information about their financial stability and future growth potential. Therefore, you can assess this information against your portfolio to see what best complements it.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Inclusion of these stocks allows you the most invested balance in your investment portfolio. You can thus make the large-cap stock as the centre and form your investment portfolio around it. This method will ease the investment experience.</p>
                <h2>What are the Risks Associated with Mid-Cap Stocks?</h2>
                <p>A company's graduation from small-cap, in most cases, attests to its growing profitability and productivity, until it reaches the large-cap tier, thereby increasing both the components of returns - dividends and value appreciation.</p>
                <p>However, this condition might not apply to every company falling under the mid-cap index in India. A few risks associated with these stocks are -</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Value Trap:</strong> A value trap is when a company consistently operates in low profits with limited cash flow, and cannot break through the phase. Mid-cap companies, especially the low-ranking ones, are prone to a value trap and might go defunct if the trend continues for a longer period.</li>
                    <li><strong>Inadequate resources:</strong> Mid-cap companies are likely to have less efficient managerial and organizational infrastructure than large-cap companies. Therefore, even though they reap high profits and attract value appreciation, they might not be equipped to utilize the same optimally.</li>
                    <li><strong>Effect of a financial bubble:</strong> A mid-cap company's exceptional performance can be a result of an unstable financial bubble. Most of these companies, however, do not have the financial fortitude to withstand when the bubble pops. Therefore, when scouring through the best mid-cap stocks, ensure to check their financial history pre-bubble to determine their financial fortitude accurately.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>What are Some Alternative Options to Mid-Cap Stocks?</h2>
                <p>Here are some investment options which offer lower risks compared to mid-cap stocks and an assured avenue of returns -</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Sovereign Bonds:</strong> These bonds are issued by the government and promise a regular source of income over a fixed period with minimum risk.</li>
                    <li><strong>Debt Funds:</strong> These funds are used to invest in fixed income securities such as debentures, bonds, treasury bills, etc. They provide steady income against comparatively lower risk.</li>
                    <li><strong>Balanced Funds:</strong> These funds are used to purchase both stocks and debt instruments. Therefore, they diversify your investment portfolio while striking a balance between high returns and measured risk.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>You can consult a market professional regarding your investment to decide on the choice of the best investment option to bank on your capital.</p>
