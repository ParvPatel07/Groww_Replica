                <h1>What is SENSEX?</h1>

                <p>Sensex is a portmanteau of two terms - Sensitive and Index, and was coined by Deepak Mohoni, a stock market expert.</p>
                <h2>What is Sensex?</h2>
                <p>Sensex is primarily used to denote the most popular market index of 30 companies listed under the Bombay Stock Exchange.</p>
                <p>This component companies listed in this index today are some of the biggest companies in the country with the most actively traded stocks.</p>
                <p>Companies included under it are selected by S&P BSE Index Committee based on the following five criteria -</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Companies have to be listed under the Bombay Stock Exchange in India.</li>
                    <li>It must consist of large or mega-cap stocks.</li>
                    <li>It has to be relatively liquid.</li>
                    <li>It must generate earnings from core activities.</li>
                    <li>Companies must contribute to keep the sector balanced with the country's equity market.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Ever since opening up in the 1990s, it has witnessed rapid growth, especially post 2000. For instance, in 2002, information technology companies formed the index, and in 2003, it was for the fast-moving. The growth curve can be traced to rapid rise in Gross Domestic Product (GDP), along with the stock market.</p>
                <p>Some of the companies under this index include Axis Bank, Asian Paints, Bajaj Finance, Bharti Airtel, HCL Technologies, Hindustan Unilever, ICICI Bank, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Larsen & Toubro, etc.</p>

                <h2>How is Sensex Calculated?</h2>
                <p>BSE maintains Sensex share composition from time to time to ensure that it reflects the current conditions of the stock market. At first, the index was calculated based on a weighted method of market capitalization.</p>
                <p>However, since 2003, this calculation method was reformed and now integrates a free-float capitalization method.</p>
                <p>This free-float method is an alternative of market capitalization method, where instead of a company's outstanding shares, the number of shares available for sale on the market is used to calculate the index. This means that only the shares that are available for public trading are considered, and the shares held by promoters and insiders are excluded.</p>
                <p>This formula for the index is:</p>
                <p>[Free Float Market Capitalization รท Market Capitalization] ร Free Float Factor</p>
                <p>This factor is the ratio of floated shares to outstanding shares. According to this free-float capitalization method, the index level accurately demonstrates the free-float value of the 30 listed companies under Sensex, relative to a base period.</p>

                <h2>How to Invest in Sensex?</h2>
                <p>These are the major steps that must be followed before starting your investment in Sensex:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Opening a Demat account</b></li>
                </ul>
                <p>It is important to have a Demat account that holds your shares in electronic form.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Opening a Trading Account</b></li>
                </ul>
                <p>After opening a Demat account, you should register yourself for opening a trading account. As BSE does not allow direct purchase or sale of securities. With the help of a trading account, one can easily buy and sell securities online.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Having a Bank Account</b></li>
                </ul>
                <p>Other than having a Demat and trading account, an investor must also have a bank account and PAN card to trade on Sensex.</p>
