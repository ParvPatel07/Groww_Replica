                <h1>What is Intraday Trading?</h1>
                <p>Purchasing and selling securities listed in a stock exchange on the same day is known as Intraday Trading. The trading happens within the operational hours of the stock exchange on a particular day and does not extend overnight. Unlike traditional investing, where one holds securities for an extended period, Intraday trading focuses on capitalizing on short-term price movements.</p>
                <p>Intraday traders seek to profit from small fluctuations in stock prices by opening and closing positions before the market closes. This requires a keen understanding of market dynamics, technical analysis, and quick decision-making.</p>

                <h2>How to Do Intraday Trading</h2>
                <p>It is essential to identify the best Intraday stocks while undertaking such Investments, as it has relatively higher risks.</p>

                <h3>Choose Highly Liquid Stocks</h3>
                <p>Liquidity is a prime feature of Intraday stocks, as without this feature, such trade would not be possible. Equity shares of small and mid-cap companies can be easily bought and sold, as well as experience tremendous volatility during market fluctuations.</p>
                <p>The cyclical variations should be carefully observed by analyzing 50-weeks high and low values, as it gives a precise idea about whether an Individual should assume long or short positions while Investing.</p>

                <h3>Volatility</h3>
                <p>Best intraday stocks tend to possess medium to high volatility in price fluctuations. Generally, market value fluctuations more than 3% should be avoided while performing Intraday trading, as the possibility of incurring a loss is huge in case of an adverse downturn in the stock market in an economy.</p>

                <h3>Strong Correlation</h3>
                <p>It is ideal to undertake Intraday share trading in high correlation with a benchmark Index of a reputed stock exchange. Thus, substantial movement in share prices can be observed when Index value tends to fluctuate.</p>
                <p>Since benchmark Indices consist of shares of top companies listed in a stock exchange, it can be assumed that fluctuations in Index value would reflect on corresponding shares accordingly. Thus, capital appreciation through Intraday trading will be substantial if this rule is followed.</p>

                <h3>Higher Trade Volume</h3>
                <p>Intraday Investors can track the trade volume Index of a particular security to identify price fluctuations. A higher trade volume Index reflects either excessive demand or supply depending upon an underlying company's performance. Capital appreciation gain can be earned through both purchase and sale transactions in such cases.</p>

                <h2>Benefits of Intraday Trading</h2>
                <p>Transacting in Intraday share has the following advantages -</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Lower Risk</strong></li>
                </ul>
                <p>Since securities are purchased on the same day in Intraday trading, risk of incurring substantial losses are minimised. However, in case of standard trading wherein the principal is lost based in for a considerable period, changes in price can be significant, making an Investor worse off in case of stock market downturns.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Lower Commission Charges</strong></li>
                </ul>
                <p>Stockbrokers charge nominal fees while transacting in Intraday trading stocks, as delivery services of transferring securities to an Investor's demat account is not made use of. For cash trade fees, services tax, etc. are so inclusive in brokerage fees, and such deductions reduce the Income of an Investor.</p>
                <p>Generally, brokerage fees on Intraday trading stocks are one-tenth of what is levied if standard trading is undertaken.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Higher Profits</strong></li>
                </ul>
                <p>Intraday trading is known to yield massive wealth creation for Investors, provided accurate Investment strategies are applied. Capital appreciation in a rising stock market can be achieved easily. In case of adverse market conditions, Intraday share traders use the method of short-selling to earn profits.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Liquidity</strong></li>
                </ul>
                <p>Another benefit of Intraday trading is that total financial resources Invested can be quickly recovered at any time. It is because sales and purchase transactions are done on the same day. This preserves liquidity requirements of an Investor to meet any personal needs.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Capital Gains through Market Fluctuations</strong></li>
                </ul>
                <p>Investors can profit through Intraday trading in both bullish and bearish markets, depending upon the Investment strategy adopted in such situations. Capital appreciation in a bullish market can be achieved by purchase and sale of securities. While in a bearish market, in the event of the stock market downturn, profits can be generated through short-selling financial Instruments.</p>

                <h2>Associated Risks</h2>
                <p>An Investor needs to have extensive knowledge about the Intraday workings of the stock market for realising adequate profits. It may seem overwhelming for a novice Investor looking to generate capital gains. It is essential to select securities of appropriate companies in such cases, for which precise analysis of financial records is required to be done.</p>
                <p>Market volatility plays an important role when it comes to Intraday trading stocks. In case of unexpected market fluctuations, Investors can incur losses. Technical analysis of markets is based on past volatility, and thereby, might not be 100% accurate in all Instances.</p>

                <h2>Alternative Trading Methods</h2>
                <p>Investors wary of Intraday trading in the stock market can choose from various trading methods, such as:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Standard Trading</strong></li>
                </ul>
                <p>Under this trading method, Individuals can Invest in stocks of different companies. It is generally undertaken for a more extended period, wherein Investors can profit from both capital appreciation and periodical dividend payments.</p>
                <p>However, such trading has to be done through a brokerage firm, wherein the percentages of total profits are deducted as pay-outs. As periodical receipts from Invested securities are obtained, brokerage fees only consume a small part of the Investment. Despite this, brokerage services are very expensive. Standard trading remains a most profitable Investable securities in the market, acting as a stable Investment option for novice Investors.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Momentum Trading</strong></li>
                </ul>
                <p>Capital appreciation is the primary target in momentum trading. Investors purchase securities having a high potential for growth in the future, but the prices are suppressed due to market fluctuations. Relative or absolute momentum Investment strategies can be Implemented, wherein stocks of companies underperforming either in a relative or absolute sense are chosen.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Swing Trading</strong></li>
                </ul>
                <p>Similar to momentum trading, swing trading generates capital gains through short-term Investment strategies. Volatile stocks are targeted in such cases, and procured shares are sold off as soon as a massive movement in prices is witnessed.</p>
