                <h1>Stock Market Timings in India</h1>
                <p>Trade in the stock market can only be undertaken during a specific time interval in India. Retail customers have to perform such transactions through a brokerage agency in between 9:15 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. on weekdays.</p>
                <p>Most Investors undertake purchase/sale of securities listed on the major stock exchanges in India - <a href="bombay_stock_exchange.html">Bombay Stock Exchange</a> (BSE) and <a href="national_stock_exchange.html">National Stock Exchange</a> (NSE). Bullion Stock Exchange transactions are also listed here.</p>
                <h2>Indian Stock Market Timings for Trade is Divided into Three Segments</h2>
                <p>Listed here is the share market timings in India:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Pre-opening timing</strong></li>
                </ul>
                <p>This session lasts from 9:00 a.m. to 9:15 a.m. Orders to purchase or sell any securities can be placed during this India share market opening timing into three sessions:</p>
                <p><strong>9:00 a.m. - 9:08 a.m.</strong></p>
                <p>During this stock market opening time in India, order for any transaction can take place. The order entry is given preference when actual trading begins, as these orders are cleared off in the beginning.</p>
                <p>Any requests placed during this time can be changed or cancelled according to need, which is beneficial to Investors, and no orders can be placed after this period of 8 minutes during the pre-opening session.</p>
                <p><strong>9:08 a.m. - 9:12 a.m.</strong></p>
                <p>This segment of Indian share market timing is responsible for price determination of security. Price matching of the requests to purchase and sell securities takes place during this segment. Transactions are given priority who want to purchase or sell a security, respectively.</p>
                <p>Determination of final prices at which trading will begin during normal Indian stock market timing is done through this phase under price matching.</p>
                <p>Price matching order entry plays a vital role in determining the price at which the security is transacted during a normal session of Indian stock market timing.</p>
                <p>However, Insertion or modification of any order already placed in not available during this session.</p>
                <p><strong>9:12 a.m. - 9:15 a.m.</strong></p>
                <p>This time acts as a transition period between pre-opening and normal Indian share market timing. No additional orders can be placed during this period, although pre-stock market orders already placed from 9:00 a.m. - 9:15 a.m. cannot be revised as well.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Normal Session</strong></li>
                </ul>
                <p>This is the primary Indian share market timing lasting from 9:15 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. Any transactions made during this session takes place as of the current market value. Indian stock prices are also determined during this segment.</p>
                <p>Intraday trading can only be undertaken during this segment. Intraday trading is a type of trading where an Investor buys and sells securities on the same day. Trading in the normal session is done throughout the week, excluding public holidays. Securities can be sold and purchased anytime during this session.</p>
                <p>Bid-based ordering system is volatile, thereby initiating several market fluctuations which are ultimately cushioned by circuit breakers. This system is used during normal Indian stock market timing from 9:15 a.m. - 3:30 p.m. session and was incorporated in Indian stock market timings.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Post-closing Session</strong></li>
                </ul>
                <p>Indian stock market closing time in India is at 3:30 p.m. No exchange takes place after this period. However, the transaction of closing price is done during this time, which has a significant effect on the following day's opening security price.</p>
                <h2>Stock Market Closing Time in India can be Divided into Two Sessions</h2>
                <p>Here are the closing share market timings in India-</p>
                <p><strong>3:30 p.m. - 3:40 p.m.</strong></p>
                <p>The closing price is calculated using a weighted average of prices of securities trading from 3 p.m. - 3:30 p.m. in a day. Securities with low liquidity and those traded on specific indices such as <a href="nifty.html">Nifty</a>, <a href="sensex.html">Sensex</a>, <a href="cnps.html">CNPS</a>, <a href="index.html">Index</a>, etc. weighted average of prices of listed securities are considered.</p>
                <p><strong>3:40 p.m. - 4 p.m.</strong></p>
                <p>This period is a post-stock market closing time where bids for the following day's trade can be placed. Bids placed during this time are confirmed, provided adequate buyers and sellers are present in the market. These transactions are done as per the closing price of a security that was determined in the first period.</p>
                <p>Thus, capital gains can be realised if opening price exceeds closing price by an Investor who has already placed their bids. No post-closing price exceeds opening share price. Bids can be cancelled during the narrow window of 3:40 p.m. - 4 p.m.</p>
                <p>The overall stock market opening time in India can be demonstrated by the following table:</p>

                <p>Stock market Investments can only be undertaken through brokerage agencies for standard customers. Orders for specific securities can be placed online, and a stockbroker having direct Investment access can transact the request with a T+3 settlement buffer period.</p>

Also, trading of <a href="mutual_funds.html">Mutual Funds</a> NW is conducted after market closes for the day, wherein prices are determined through Net asset Value of shares in as per closing time.</p>
