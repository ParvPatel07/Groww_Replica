                <ul>
                    <li><strong>No takers</strong></li>
                </ul>
                <p>Generally, equity experts want to ensure that equity shares Investors these days have a better understanding of how the Investment market functions and which activities would prove more effective for them.

                    <li><strong>Inefficient Capital Generation</strong></li>

                <p>When companies Issued a huge number of shares at low face values, they run the chance of gaining a larger number of shareholders in the company.</p>
                <p>Having a large shareholder base proves effective only in the case when the number of shareholders is within a manageable range. When the number becomes unmanageable, it adds on to the company's liability as well as they have to pay the shareholders out of their profits. Also, it poses the risk of the shareholders interfering with the company's management.</p>
                <p>Companies with large shareholder base may also lose control over the company in the event of hostile takeovers. Thus, companies have to incur substantial losses when equity shares are diluted beyond a certain limit.</p>
