                <h1>What is NIFTY?</h1>

                <p>NIFTY, also known as NIFTY 50, is the flagship index of the National Stock Exchange (NSE) in India. It represents the weighted average of 50 of the largest Indian companies listed on the NSE.</p>

                <h2>Understanding NIFTY</h2>
                <p>NIFTY is a market capitalization-weighted index that tracks the performance of 50 large-cap companies across 13 sectors of the Indian economy. It is one of the two main stock indices used in India, the other being the SENSEX of the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE).</p>
                <p>The name "NIFTY" is derived from the combination of "National" and "Fifty", indicating that it represents the 50 largest companies listed on the NSE.</p>

                <h2>How is NIFTY Calculated?</h2>
                <p>NIFTY is calculated using the free-float market capitalization weighted method. This means that:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Only the shares that are available for trading in the market (free-float) are considered</li>
                    <li>The weight of each stock in the index is proportional to its free-float market capitalization</li>
                    <li>The base value of NIFTY is 1000, and the base date is November 3, 1995</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The formula for calculating NIFTY is:</p>
                <p>NIFTY = (Current Market Value / Base Market Capital) Ã— Base Index Value</p>

                <p>The NIFTY share index is managed by a team of professionals at the NSE Indices Limited. It formed an Indian Advisory Committee that offers its expertise and guidance on agreeable issues pertaining to equity indices.</p>
                <p>NIFTY trading takes place with a base value which is fixed or adjusted and is considered high as 1000. For example, the year of index demonstration. The aggregate market value of stocks present in the index is 2.06 Lakh Crore. Such a value gives a NIFTY of value 2.06. If the market cap is 2.06 Lakh Crore, then the market value of NIFTY stocks is considered to be 2.06. If the market value of stocks present in the index is 2.06 Lakh Crore, and the base value of the index is set at 1000, and the base market cap is 1.03 Lakh Crore, the NIFTY is calculated using a formula:</p>
                <p>The formula for calculating price index is listed below -</p>
                <p>Index Value = Current MV or market value / (Base Market Capital * 1000)</p>
                <p>The methodology involved in the calculation of indices also considers changes in corporate actions, which for instance comprises of rights issuance, stock splits, etc.</p>

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>Broad indices such as NIFTY and Sensex are used as a benchmark for Mutual Funds to measure their performance. The former is the broader of the two indices, thus offering a much more comprehensive standard of the Indian stock market.</p>
