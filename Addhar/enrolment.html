                <h1>Aadhaar Card Enrolment Centres</h1>
                <p>Aadhaar number is a 12-digit dynamic identification number that serves as a confirmation of an individual's identity and address. It is issued by UIDAI. Such a self-attested document also includes details about the individual's biometrics and demographic information. These details are provided at the Aadhaar enrolment desk and need to be kept as accurate as possible.</p>
                <p>The Aadhaar Enrolment Form is available both online and offline. This allows individuals to submit the form at their convenience. The process is in sync with UIDAI, which has various locations for Aadhaar update. To complete this process, you must visit an authorized Aadhaar Enrolment Centre. These centres are available in cities across the country. The process is simple and quick, and the government has opened these to target the right audience so they easily access Aadhaar services.</p>
                <h2>Aadhaar Enrolment Online</h2>
                <p>Enrolment in Aadhaar may be accomplished by following these easy steps:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Download the Aadhaar Enrolment Form from the UIDAI website, or get it downloaded from there, and then pay to print it.</li>
                    <li>Enter the needed information precisely, and check for any misrepresentation or suppression of information.</li>
                    <li>Once you have filled in the form, take it to any authorized Aadhaar enrolment and verification center, along with the required documents for proof of identity, address, and date of birth. Submit the form and documents to the operator. Biometric authentication will be done for verification. You will also be required to provide your State, PIN Code, and Search Radius.</li>
                    <li>Please provide thumb print and or signature here.</li>
                    <li>The provided photograph is used as your enrolment photo; another photograph will be taken.</li>
                    <li>You will get an acknowledgement slip, including your enrolment number, which will allow you to follow the progress of your Aadhaar card status.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Aadhaar Enrolment through Aadhaar Enrolment Center:</h2>

                <ul>
                    <li>Fill the form completely and accurately, making sure there is no misrepresentation or suppression of information.</li>
                    <li>Submit the form together with copies of address, identity, and age verification. Remember to bring the originals for verification.</li>
                    <li>Biometric authentication will be done for verification.</li>
