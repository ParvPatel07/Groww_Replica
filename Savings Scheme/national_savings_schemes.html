                <h1>National Savings Scheme (NSS)</h1>
                <p>Typically, national savings schemes are savings instruments launched or backed by the government and operated through post offices and public sector banks. These schemes offer investors assured returns with minimal risk. National savings schemes aim to mobilize small savings and help individuals build a substantial corpus eventually. Further, the rates of return under such schemes are often higher than traditional bank fixed deposits.</p>
                <p>Most of the national savings schemes can be categorised based on the beneficiary categories they are directed to. Each of such schemes comes with pre-fixed eligibility criteria and offers an array of features and benefits. Hence, before making any investment under these schemes, investors must look into their profitable schemes in detail.</p>

                <h2>Types of National Saving Schemes</h2>
                <p>Depending on the targeted beneficiaries, the schemes are divided into categories, namely â€“ regular NSS schemes, savings plans for senior citizens and schemes for the girl child. Take a look:</p>

                        <p>Only resident Indians can invest in the scheme at their resident post office with a minimum investment of Rs. 1000. Joint accounts can be opened by up to 3 adults and for minors above 10 years of age. Individuals are also allowed to open a Post Office Monthly Income account jointly with 2 or 3 applicants, whereby the minimum amount per account is Rs. 15 Lakh. A lumpsum amount is pre-deposited by the government and is returned annually.</p>
                    </li>

                        <p>For instance, Mr Ashok invests Rs. 1000 into this scheme for nine months which accrues interest at the rate of 7.2% p.a. On scheme completion, the maturity amount from this national savings scheme would be Rs. 9,000.</p>
                    </li>

Here, the interest on deposits up to Rs. 10,000 per year is tax-free, while interest earned on deposits up to Rs. 1000 in a financial year, however, has no such tax rebates are offered on the accrued interest.</p>

                        <h4>Kisan Vikas Patra</h4>

                        <h4>National Savings Certificate</h4>
