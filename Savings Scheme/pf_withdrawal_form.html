                <h1>PF Withdrawal Form</h1>
                <p>A PF withdrawal form, short for Provident Fund withdrawal form, is a document that allows concerned individuals to withdraw a certain amount from their PF corpus.</p>

                <h2>What Is the Purpose of the PF Claim Form?</h2>
                <p>During employment, both the employee and the employer are required to contribute equally to EPF or the Employees' Provident Fund Scheme. The employee's contribution is deducted as a percentage of their basic salary plus dearness allowance.</p>
                <p>The purpose of <a href="#">EPF</a> is large, and the scheme is specific to it encourages the accretion of adequate funds during an individual's working life and save it for their retirement needs. However, Provident Fund schemes and the tax rules also allow the accumulated corpus to cover specific financial emergencies. To withdraw these funds, one needs to fill out and submit the appropriate form. There are different types of PF claim forms depending on the purpose of the withdrawal.</p>

                <h2>Complete EPF Withdrawal</h2>
                <p>EPF can be withdrawn completely in the following circumstances:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>When a person retires.</li>
                    <li>When a person is out of work for more than two months, individuals must obtain an attestation from a gazetted officer or manager confirming unemployment.</li>
                </ul>
                 <p>Individuals cannot withdraw their entire EPF balance while changing jobs. If they have not been unemployed for two months (which is generally the gap period between changing jobs).</p>

                <h2>Partial EPF Withdrawal</h2>
                <p>Only in emergency circumstances can a portion of an EPF balance be withdrawn.</p>

                <h2>Different Types of PF Withdrawal Forms Available</h2>

                    <li>Only after retirement may the complete sum from the EPF account be withdrawn. EPFO considers early retirement to be withdrawal after the age of 54.</li>
                    <li>Partially withdrawing EPF funds is only permissible in the event of a medical emergency, home acquisition or renovation, marriage, or debt.</li>
                    <li>EPFO permits a withdrawal of 90% of the whole amount one year before retirement.</li>
                    <li>If an employee is laid off or discontinues his/her job for his/her own accord, he/she is eligible for EPF withdrawal.</li>
                    <li>According to the new rule, only 75% of the corpus can be withdrawn after one month of unemployment. After two months of unemployment, the employee is eligible to withdraw the remaining 25%.</li>
                    <li>Employees are not required to obtain permission from their employer before withdrawing their EPF. They can receive permission online by attaching their UAN and Aadhaar to their EPF account.</li>
                </ul>
