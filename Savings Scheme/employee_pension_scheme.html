                <h1>Employee Pension Scheme (EPS)</h1>
                <p>Employee Pension Scheme (EPS) 1995 was introduced in 1995 by the National Savings Scheme Department. This scheme is applicable to all employees who are eligible for EPF. It is a retirement savings scheme that provides pension benefits to employees upon retirement or in case of death or disability.</p>

                <h2>What is EPS 1995?</h2>
                <p>EPS 1995, also known as the Employee Pension Scheme, is a type of social security scheme launched by the EPFO (Employees' Provident Fund Organisation) in 1995 for employees in the organized sector. It is a mandatory scheme for employees who are eligible for EPF.</p>
                <p>The EPS Scheme is funded by a contribution from the employer, which is diverted from the employer's contribution to EPF. The government also contributes to the scheme. The accumulated amount in the EPS account is used to provide pension benefits to the employee upon retirement or to their family in case of death or disability.</p>

                <h2>Who Should Come Under the EPS?</h2>
                <p>The Employee Pension Scheme covers all employees who are eligible for EPF. This includes employees who are working in the organized sector and drawing a salary of up to Rs. 15,000 per month.</p>
                <p>The EPS Benefits are available for both new and existing EPF members. Once an employee becomes a member of EPF, they automatically become a member of EPS as well.</p>

                <h3>Did go on Pension under Higher Salary?</h3>
                <p>According to the circulars issued by the Ministry of Labour & Employment on 3rd May 2022, employees who are opting for a higher EPS pension will not be required to contribute 8.33% of the higher salary towards EPS. The Ministry of Labour & Employment has decided that the wage ceiling will now be above than the 1.16% of the employer's contribution.</p>
                <p>However, according to the EPFO latest circular issued on 15th June 2022, for employees who have contributed on higher wages and are opting for a higher pension, they will be required to contribute 1.16% of the salary above the wage ceiling towards EPS. This contribution will be made by the employee.</p>
                <p>This latest development is a significant change for employees who were contributing on higher wages and were expecting a higher pension without any additional contribution. With this new rule, employees will have to contribute an additional amount to receive a higher pension.</p>

                <h2>Responsibilities of Employers</h2>
                <p>Here are the key responsibilities of employers regarding pension contribution in EPS:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Firstly and out of the contributions payable by the employer in each month, a part of the contribution is diverted towards the EPS scheme. The employer is required to deposit the employer's contribution towards EPS within 15 days of the close of every month to the Employees Pension Fund.</li>
                    <li>Secondly, the employer is required to submit a return to the EPFO every month with the details of the contributions made towards EPS for each employee. This return is also to be submitted within 15 days of the close of every month.</li>
                    <li>Thirdly, upon the retirement or exit of an employee, the employer is required to submit a withdrawal form to the EPFO. This form is to be submitted within 30 days of the employee's exit.</li>
                    <li>Fourthly, in case of the demise of an employee, the employer is required to submit a death claim form to the EPFO. This form is to be submitted within 30 days of the employee's death.</li>
                    <li>Fifthly, for any other pension-related claims, the employer is required to submit the relevant forms and documents to the EPFO.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Employers are also responsible for maintaining records of the contributions made towards EPS for each employee and providing the same to the employee and the EPFO as and when required.</p>

                <h2>Eligibility Criteria Applicable for EPS</h2>
                <p>The following are the eligibility criteria for receiving pension benefits under EPS:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The employee must have completed at least 10 years of eligible service. Eligible service includes the period for which contributions have been made to the EPS account.</li>
                    <li>The employee must have reached the age of retirement, which is 58 years. However, employees can opt for early pension from the age of 50 with reduced benefits.</li>
                    <li>The employee must have made contributions to the EPS account for at least 10 years.</li>
                    <li>In case of death or disability of an employee, their family members are eligible to receive pension benefits irrespective of the employee's age or length of service.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>To get the pension benefits under EPS as a retired employee, the employee must set up a minimum of 10 years of qualifying service and should be at an age of retirement, which is 58 years. However, in case of disability, there is no minimum age or service requirement. The family members are also eligible to receive pension benefits in case of death of the employee, irrespective of the employee's age or length of service.</p>

                <h2>How to Calculate Your Pension Under EPS</h2>
                <p>The pension amount under EPS is calculated based on the employee's average salary during the last 12 months of service and the total length of service. The formula for calculating the monthly pension is:</p>

                <h3>Monthly Pension = (Average salary during the last 12 months of service x Length of service) / 70</h3>
                <p>However, there are certain conditions and limitations on the pension amount. The maximum pension amount is Rs. 7,500 per month. Also, in case of early pension, the pension amount is reduced by 4% for each year of early retirement.</p>

                <h3>Pension Salary</h3>
                <p>The pension salary is calculated based on the average salary during the last 12 months of service. However, there is a wage ceiling of Rs. 15,000 per month for calculating the pension salary. So, even if an employee is drawing a salary of more than Rs. 15,000 per month, the pension salary will be calculated based on Rs. 15,000.</p>

                <p>For EPS pension calculation, the salary is taken as the average of the last 12 months' pay. For instance, if the salary of a person is Rs. 10,000 and he joins the organization on the 2nd of the month, then the salary for that month will be calculated as Rs. 10,000 / 30 * 29 days, which is Rs. 9,667. The average salary over the last 12 months will be used for pension calculation. So, if the average salary is Rs. 10,000, the monthly pension will be calculated as (10000 * Length of service) / 70.</p>
                <p>In case of employees who were contributing on higher wages, the pension salary will be calculated based on the actual salary drawn, subject to a maximum of Rs. 15,000. However, with the new rule requiring employees to contribute an additional amount for a higher pension, the pension salary will be calculated based on the actual salary drawn without any ceiling.</p>

                <h3>Pensionable Service</h3>
                <p>The pensionable service is the total service period for which contributions have been made to the EPS account. However, there are certain conditions and limitations on the pensionable service. The maximum pensionable service is 35 years. Also, in case of early pension, the pensionable service is reduced by the number of years of early retirement.</p>
                <p>Every time an employee switches jobs, he needs to submit EPS Scheme Certificate and submit it to the new employer every time he changes a job.</p>
                <p>The employee has to get the EPS Scheme Certificate issued and submit it to the new employer every time he changes a job.</p>

                <p>It is important to note that the service counted for pension is the total service period for which contributions have been made to the EPS account. For instance, if an employee has worked for 10 years and then leaves the job, their pensionable service will be 10 years. If the employee joins another job and works for another 10 years, their total pensionable service will be 20 years.</p>
                <p>However, the employee will be eligible for pension only if they have completed at least 10 years of eligible service and have reached the age of 58 years.</p>
                <p>Before completing the service period of 10 years, if the member withdraws the EPS corpus and joins another company, he will have to start contributing to the basic EPS account, and he will have to start fresh as the previous service will not be counted.</p>
                <p>The consideration of the pensionable service is up to 35 years. Hence, the minimum pensionable service required is 10 years for pension eligibility. This is to be noted that for pension calculation, the length of service is taken as the actual service period for which contributions have been made to the EPS account, up to a maximum of 35 years.</p>

                <h2>Types of Pensions Under the Employees' Pension Scheme</h2>
                <p>There are different types of pensions under EPS 95 pension scheme, such as pensions for widows, children, and orphans, which support the family members of the pension.</p>

                <h3>1) Widow Pension</h3>
                <p>Under the Widow Pension option, the widow of a deceased employee is eligible for a pension. The pension amount will be payable until the death of the widow or her remarriage. In case of more than one widow, the pension amount will be payable to the eldest widow.</p>

                <h3>2) Child Pension</h3>
                <p>For up to two children of the family, in addition to monthly Widow Pension, are eligible for child pension in case of the member's death. The monthly pension will be paid till the child attains the age of 25 years. The payable amount is 25% of the widow pension, and to a maximum of two children amount can be paid.</p>

                <h3>3) Orphan Pension</h3>
                <p>Children of the member will be entitled to get the monthly orphan pension of 75% of the value of the monthly widow pension. This is payable to children below 25 years in case the deceased member leaves behind no widow. For a maximum of two children, this pension is payable. This pension is provided to orphans in case both parents are deceased.</p>

                <h3>4) Reduced Pension</h3>
                <p>A member of the EPFO can withdraw an early pension if he has completed 10 years of service and has reached the age of 50 years but is less than 58 years. In this case, the age is less than 58 years at a rate of 4% for every year the pension amount is slashed.</p>

                <p>In case the member decides to withdraw the monthly reduced pension at the age of 54 years, he will get the pension with a reduced amount of 16% (4% per year * 4 years early retirement). This option is suitable for employees who wish to retire early and are willing to accept a reduced pension amount.</p>

                <h2>Types of Pensions Forms under EPS in India</h2>
                <p>In order to avail of the benefits of the employee pension scheme, the following form needs to be filled by the member or the survivors of EPFO Members.</p>
