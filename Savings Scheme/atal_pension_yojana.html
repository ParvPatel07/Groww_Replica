                <h1>Atal Pension Yojana (APY)</h1>
                <p>Atal Pension Yojana is a pension scheme introduced by the Government of India in 2015-16. It is implemented through banks and administered by the Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority of India (PFRDA).</p>
                <p>It is an extension of the recognized National Pension Scheme and replaces the previously instituted Swavalamban Yojana. The scheme is primarily aimed at providing social security to workers in the unorganized sector. Individuals who are between 18 and 40 years of age, who were eligible for co-contributions from the Indian government for 5 years, can apply for the scheme.</p>

                <h2>What is Atal Pension Yojana?</h2>
                <p>Atal Pension Yojana is a social security scheme backed by the Government of India. It is aimed at providing regular pension income to workers primarily in the unorganized sector of India, to make them financially independent in their old age. A person who joins the scheme at 18 years of age or less, and contributes regularly, would receive a monthly pension of ₹5000 upon reaching 60 years of age.</p>
                <p>The scheme is primarily targeted at the vast majority of Indian workers who are employed in the unorganized sector and do not have access to formal pension plans. It is a defined benefit scheme, meaning the pension amount is fixed and guaranteed by the government. This provides a sense of security and stability for beneficiaries in their old age, protecting them from financial uncertainty.</p>

                <h2>What is the Objective of the APY Scheme?</h2>
                <p>This pension scheme is targeted to mitigate the basic financial obligations of individuals that crop up in their retirement years. It is a guaranteed pension scheme, and the pension amount that individuals would receive is directly dependent on the monthly contributions they decide to make and their age.</p>
                <p>Beneficiaries of Atal Pension Yojana (APY) shall receive their accumulated corpus in the form of monthly payments after they retire from their respective jobs. In case of the death of the beneficiary, the spouse shall receive the same pension amount. In case of the death of both individuals, the beneficiary's nominee shall receive the accumulated corpus in a lump sum.</p>

                <h2>APY Scheme Details and Features</h2>
                <p>Details of the APY scheme are enumerated below:</p>

                <h3>Automatic Debit</h3>
                <p>One of the primary conveniences of the Atal Pension Yojana is the facility of automatic debit. The bank account of a beneficiary is linked with his/her pension account and the monthly contributions are directly debited. This ensures timely contributions and uninterrupted pension accumulation. It is essential to ensure sufficient funds are available in the linked account to avoid penalties.</p>

                <h3>Facility to Increase Contributions</h3>
                <p>As mentioned before, the pension amount one is eligible to receive upon reaching the age of 60 is correlated with the monthly contributions made. Individuals have the flexibility to increase or decrease their contributions during the accumulation phase, within the defined limits. This allows them to adjust their contributions based on their financial capacity and desired pension amount.</p>

                <h3>Assured Pension</h3>
                <p>The Atal Pension Yojana guarantees a fixed monthly pension amount to the beneficiary after they reach 60 years of age. The pension amount is chosen by the individual at the time of joining the scheme, ranging from ₹1000 to ₹5000 per month. The government also co-contributes to eligible beneficiaries' accounts for the first 5 years, further enhancing the accumulated corpus.</p>

                <h3>Investment Restrictions</h3>
                <p>Individuals who are above 18 years and below 40 years of age are eligible to invest in the Atal Pension Yojana. There are no restrictions on the amount of contribution other than the minimum monthly contribution based on the chosen pension amount and age. The scheme is primarily for individuals in the unorganized sector who do not have access to other pension schemes.</p>

                <h3>Withdrawal Rules</h3>
                <p>If a beneficiary has attained the age of 60, he/she shall be eligible to receive the entire corpus amount, i.e. receive the pension amount as per the chosen monthly pension amount.</p>
                <p>One can only exit the scheme before reaching the age of 60 under certain circumstances such as terminal illness or death. In case of death, the spouse can continue to receive the same pension or claim the accumulated corpus. In case of death of both the beneficiary and spouse, the nominee receives the lump sum corpus.</p>

                <h3>Terms of Penalty</h3>
                <p>For any delays in the payment of contributions, the following penalty charges are applicable:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Rs. 1 for monthly contributions up to Rs. 100.</li>
                    <li>Rs. 2 for monthly contributions within Rs. 101 and Rs. 500.</li>
                    <li>Rs. 5 for monthly contributions within Rs. 501 and Rs. 1000.</li>
                    <li>Rs. 10 for monthly contributions beyond Rs. 1000.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>In case of continued default in payment for 6 consecutive months, such account shall be frozen and if such default continues for 12 consecutive months, that Account shall be deactivated and the amount thus accumulated shall be paid to the subscriber.</p>

                <h3>Tax Exemption</h3>
                <p>The exemption is available on contributions made by individuals towards Atal Pension Yojana under Section 80CCD of the Income Tax Act, 1961. Under Section 80CCD(1B), individuals can claim an additional deduction of up to ₹50,000 for contributions to NPS or APY, over and above the limit of ₹1.5 lakh available under Section 80C. This provides a significant tax benefit for individuals investing in the scheme.</p>

                <h2>Atal Pension Yojana Withdrawal Process</h2>
                <p>Although the Atal Pension Yojana withdrawal method was initially restricted to those above the age of 60, it has since been expanded slightly.</p>

                    <li>If you unexpectedly pass away or suffer from a serious sickness or death, you can leave the programme before reaching the age of 60. Your spouse will receive your pension if you die before reaching the age of 60. If both you and your spouse pass away, your nominee will receive your savings.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <h3>Source of Income in old age</h3>
                        <p>Individuals are provided with a steady source of income after they reach 60 years, thus financially enabling them to meet basic requirements such as medications, which is fairly common in old age.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3>Government-backed pension scheme</h3>
                        <p>This pension scheme is backed by the Indian government and regulated by Pension Funds Regulatory Authority of India (PFRDA). Hence, individuals carry no risk of loss as the government assures their pension.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3>Enabling the unorganized sector</h3>
                        <p>The scheme was launched primarily with the motive to alleviate the financial worries of individuals who are employed in the unorganized sector, thus enabling them to be financially independent in their later years.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3>Nominee facility</h3>
                        <p>In case of a beneficiary's death, his/her spouse becomes entitled to the benefits of this scheme. They can either terminate their account and avail the entire corpus in a lump sum or choose to receive the same pension amount as the original beneficiary. In case of the death of both the beneficiary and his/her spouse, a nominee shall be entitled to receive the entire corpus amount.</p>
                    </li>
