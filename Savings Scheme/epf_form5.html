                <h1>EPF Form 5</h1>
                <p>Employees Provident Fund or EPF is a social security scheme offering retirement benefits, run and managed by the Employees' Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO). Form 5 is a key document used in the process of registering new employees with the EPFO. All companies with 20 or more employees are required to register with EPFO.</p>
                <p>Both employees and employers need to fill up specific forms to complete EPF related formalities like notification, contribution, transfer, or withdrawal. This document focuses on EPF Form 5, a primary form required for new joinees.</p>
                <p>Note, related to EPF, Form 5 is applicable only for employees who do not have a prior EPF account.</p>
                <p>Form 5 is applicable only to those employees who do not have a prior EPF account. PF Form 5 thus facilitates the enrollment of a newly appointed individual as a member of EPFO.</p>
                <h2>How to Get EPF Form 5?</h2>
                <p>Form 5 is available for download on the official website of EPFO as a PDF format. Employers can print the form and provide relevant details for submission.</p>
                <h2>Who Should Fill EPF Form 5?</h2>
                <p>Only employers are allowed to fill up EPF Form 5. They have to submit this form every month to notify the EPFO about new employees.</p>
                <p>The form needs to be submitted even though no new employees have joined in a month. Companies have to mention 'NIL' in the form and submit it to the regional PF office on the due date every month.</p>
                <h2>What are the Details to be Filled in EPF Form 5?</h2>
                <p>The EPF Form 5 aims to record the essential information of employees and new employees. It is a part of Paragraph 36(2)(a) of the Employees' Provident Fund Scheme, 1952.</p>
                <p>The form requires the following details about the employees for employers to fill up and submit:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The company/organization's name.</li>
                    <li>Address of the company.</li>
                    <li>Code number of the company.</li>
                    <li>The employee's account number.</li>
                    <li>Name of the employee.</li>
                    <li>Father's/Husband's name of the employee.</li>
                    <li>Date of Birth (DOB) of the employee.</li>
                    <li>Date of joining the employee.</li>
                    <li>Total salary of the employee.</li>
                    <li>Remarks provided by the employer.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>When Do Employers Have to Submit PF Form 5?</h2>
                <p>Employers have to update Form 5 every month to inform EPF authorities about new recruitments. The deadline for submitting the form is the 15th of every month for all new employees joining in the previous month, including the month of employment.</p>
                <p>If Form 5 is submitted late, a company that has employed 20 or more employees on EPF schemes with EPFO Commissioner as per the rules mentioned, can be penalized. Timely submission ensures compliance.</p>
                <p>Timely submission of employee details to EPFO authorities ensures that the new employees' database remains updated.</p>
                <h2>Where is EPF Form 5 Submitted?</h2>
                <p>Employers are required to submit EPF Form 5 to the regional EPF Commissioner, Employee Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) field office at the end of every month.</p>
                <p>The form can be submitted either online through the EPFO employer portal or physically at the regional office. It helps EPFO assign a Universal Account Number or <a href="#">UAN</a> to a member. The UAN remains the same throughout a member's employment, but the member identification number changes whenever a member switches jobs.</p>
                <h2>How to Correct Details in PF Form 5?</h2>
                <p>If there are any incorrect details in a submitted PF Form 5, employers have an option to notify and correct these details. Employers can contact their respective regional EPFO office for guidance on the correction process.</p>
                <p>Employers have to furnish the following documents for rectification of details:-</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Print Card</li>
                    <li>Employee ID Card</li>
                    <li>Aadhaar Card</li>
                    <li>Passport</li>
                    <li>Driving License</li>
                    <li>School Certifications</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The following steps would help an employer apply for rectification in Form 5 details:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Log in with your UAN and password.</li>
                    <li>Provide appropriate documents.</li>
                    <li>Sign the form.</li>
                    <li>Submit with employee's signature and the company's stamp.</li>
                    <li>Attach all required copies of documents required.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>What Other Forms Should Employers Fill Up?</h2>
                <p>Employers have to fill up and submit a host of other EPF Forms, besides Form 5. They are as follows:-</p>
