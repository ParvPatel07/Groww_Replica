                <h1>Swavalamban Pension Yojana</h1>
                <p>Swavalamban Pension Yojana is a pension scheme offering financial security and independence. The Government of India has launched several pension schemes from time to time. The Swavalamban Pension Yojana, a previous version of the National Pension Scheme (NPS), was directed towards the unorganized sector of India aimed at helping them manage their finances successfully.</p>
                <p>The Swavalamban Scheme was a government-backed, micro-pension plan monitored by the Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA). It was intended to ease the process for the unorganized sector for lifelong saving for retired life.</p>
                <p>The features and components of the pension plan further facilitated the process of building a strong retirement corpus for individuals. Additionally, the PFRDA also ensures the security of funds invested under this scheme.</p>
                <p>Under Swavalamban Pension Yojana, the minimum investment amount was Rs 1000 per annum, whereas, the maximum amount was Rs 12,000 per annum. Also, the Indian Government contributed a sum of Rs. 1,000 per annum to all active Swavalamban Scheme accounts for 5 years.</p>
                <p>Its introduction also saw an achievement of the most number of applicants for a pension scheme on its very first year. Also, by the end of the year, over 20 lakh individuals had subscribed to this pension plan and benefited accordingly.</p>
                <p>Eventually, this plan was discontinued from 2015 and was replaced by a more comprehensive retirement-friendly plan, the <a href="atal_pension_yojana.html">Atal Pension Yojana</a>.</p>

                <h2>Features of the Swavalamban Scheme</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Investment amount</b></li>
                </ul>
                <p>With minimum sum of Rs. 100, eligible candidates could open an account under the Swavalamban Pension Scheme. They would then have to invest a sum of Rs. 1,000 every year and ensure that they do not invest more than Rs. 12,000 every year. Also, the government contributed a sum of Rs. 1000 per annum from the start till the end of 5 years.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Dependence on Bank</b></li>
                </ul>
                <p>The Swavalamban Pension Yojana was not entirely dependent on a bank account. However, individuals with a bank account had a greater advantage as it was because the amount was routed through bank accounts.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Returns</b></li>
                </ul>
                <p>Unlike saving plans like FD and PPF, the rate of returns applied to Swavalamban Pension Yojana was not fixed. Mostly, the returns on this scheme depended on market forces and its returns were largely dependent on its forces.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Target beneficiaries</b></li>
                </ul>
                <p>The benefits of this pension plan were targeted, especially towards the unorganized sector sections of India. For example, farmers, self-employed and individuals belonging to the labour class were its primary target.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Funding and Tax benefits</b></li>
                </ul>
                <p>This scheme was backed by the Government of India and was to hold the pension amount. Also, investors were entitled to avail tax benefits under this scheme. To elaborate, the amount availed of withdrawal was entirely exempted from tax.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Investment pattern</b></li>
                </ul>
                <p>There was no maximum or minimum limitation on the amount of contribution directed towards Swavalamban Pension Yojana. Investors were free to deposit as low as Rs. 100 into this scheme per month. Additionally, they had to ensure that they do not invest more than Rs. 12,000 into this scheme per year.</p>

                </ul>
                <p>As much as 10% of the total sum of money was to be invested in the equity market, while 55% of it was invested in government securities and the remaining 45% was invested in corporate bonds. The scheme also offers to split funds for account holders and enabled them to diversify the burden of risk significantly.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Statement of transactions</b></li>
                </ul>
                <p>Swavalamban Pension Yojana account holders received a hard copy of their statement of transactions annually. It was compiled by a central record keeping agency and was to track the details of each contribution made and further provided a fair idea about the accumulated corpus.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Nominee facility</b></li>
                </ul>
                <p>Account holders were also allowed to avail the nominee facility extended under this pension scheme. Notably, if account holders passed away, nominees were at liberty to either claim the accumulated amount of money in a lump sum or continue with the account.</p>
                <p>These feature additions played a significant role in mobilizing individual savings towards building a sizeable retirement corpus. Further, it contributed to awareness of the scheme, making it a favorable form of investment option.</p>

                <p>The Swavalamban Pension Yojana was replaced in the year 2015 with an improved and more effective pension scheme known as the Atal Pension Yojana. Existing account holders of the pension scheme were allowed to switch to Atal Pension Yojana to retain their contributions and avail the government co-contribution benefits. Furthermore, if individuals were unable to switch or decided to exit the scheme prematurely, they had the option to withdraw the entire accumulated corpus. However, individuals were permitted to facilitate the process of becoming a beneficiary post retirement from the age bracket of anywhere from 18-60 years to 40-60 years. Other than these, both schemes were monitored and supervised by aggregators, who aided individuals to check the existing pension schemes to make a more informed decision.</p>
