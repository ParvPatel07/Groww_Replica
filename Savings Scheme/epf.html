                <h1>Employees' Provident Fund or EPF</h1>
                <p>The Employees' Provident Fund or EPF is a popular savings scheme that has been introduced by the EPFO under the supervision of the Government of India.</p>
                <p>This scheme provides an employee with an allocation (12% of an employee's basic salary and dearness allowance towards EPF). The amount can be claimed at the time of retirement, job change, or for specific needs.</p>
                <p>The accumulated amount in the EPF is tax-free and can be withdrawn without paying tax on the return. Employees' fund is a long-term savings tool for salaried individuals in India.</p>
                <p>Basically, every employee in India, who works in an organization and falls under the EPF Act, is eligible for EPF. The scheme is a great way to build a solid retirement fund and also offers tax benefits for employees, efficient, and hassle-free.</p>
                <h2>EPFO – Employee Provident Fund Organization</h2>
                <p>EPFO or Employees' Provident Fund Organization is a non-contributory body that promotes employee's long-term savings and retirement benefits.</p>
                <p>EPFO was established in 1952 and is governed by the Ministry of Labour and Employment. It further administers trust funds and schemes for employees.</p>
                <h2>Schemes Offered Under EPFO</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Employees' Provident Fund Scheme (EPF)</li>
                    <li>Employees' Pension Scheme (EPS)</li>
                    <li>Employees' Deposit Linked Insurance Scheme (EDLI)</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Objectives of EPFO</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>To provide financial security and long-term savings via an EPF account.</li>
                    <li>To ensure employees' savings are managed and regulated.</li>
                    <li>To accumulate retirement corpus for employees.</li>
                    <li>To ensure employees' savings are protected by law and regulations regularly.</li>
                    <li>To facilitate easy transfer and withdrawal of funds for employees.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>UAN and EPFO Portal</h2>
                <p>EPFO launched the Universal Account Number (UAN) to make account operations such as withdrawal and transfer easier. UAN is a 12-digit number that acts as a single umbrella for all EPF accounts of an employee, even if the employee changes employers. The UAN remains the same.</p>
                <p>The UAN provides access to the EPFO member portal, where a member can log in, check the number of Member IDs, update KYC, and transfer or withdraw funds. Employees must, however, activate their UAN to use these services.</p>
                <h2>EPF Eligibility</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>The Employee Provident Fund is for employees shown on the Public and Private Sectors, which means all employees can join and maintain an EPF fund.</li>
                    <li>Any organization that employs 20 or more salaried individuals is added to the benefits of EPF, as per the law.</li>
                    <li>After becoming an authorized member of the EPF scheme, the employee is obliged to add as well all relevant Employees' Provident Fund benefits, including nomination and transfer of funds, etc.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>EPF Interest</h2>
                <div class="disclaimer">For the Financial Year 2023-24, the declared rate of interest offered by the EPF scheme is 8.15%.</div>
                <p>The accrued interest amount is credited to investments in an EPF online account at the year's end.</p>
                <h2>EPF Calculation</h2>
                <p>The <a href="#">EPF calculator</a> is an online tool that lets you check exactly what will be in your EPF account when you retire. You can use the employer's formula to get an amount, which includes both your contribution and the employer's contribution, as well as the total interest accumulated.</p>
                <p>For example:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>If the salary is ₹20,000, then 12% of this amount would be ₹2,400 (12% x 20,000 = 2,400).</li>
                    <li>12% of the salary is deducted every month and added to the EPF account.</li>
                    <li>The employer also contributes 12% of the salary, of which 8.33% is contributed to the employee's EPS account, and the remaining 3.67% is added to the EPF account.</li>
                    <li>The combination towards the EPF account would be: 3.67% (employer) + 12% (employee) = 15.67% of the basic salary.</li>
                    <li>The total contribution is calculated as: (15.67% x salary) + interest, which is calculated monthly and added at the end of the year.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>EPF Form</h2>
                <p>EPF forms, used for the processing of any facility in an EPF, are available on the EPF account. It is registration, EPF transfer, withdrawal, or nomination, but an EPF form streamlines the process by completing each submission.</p>

                <h2>EPF Benefits</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Capital Appreciation:</strong> The EPF scheme allows the principal amount to be deposited with the EPF scheme. Additionally, accrued interest and monthly returns make principal funds higher and lead to consistent capital appreciation.</li>
                    <li><strong>Corpus for Retirement:</strong> A regular and monthly contribution is directed towards the Employees' Pension Scheme. In the long run, the amount builds up a sizeable retirement fund to help build a healthy corpus for retirement.</li>
                    <li><strong>Emergency Corpus:</strong> Uncertainties can put stress on the finances, making liquidity prepared for such an eventuality critical. In this kind of situation, you can use your EPF account for emergencies.</li>
                    <li><strong>Tax-saving:</strong> The EPF is eligible for tax rebate under Section 80C. As an employment contribution towards the EPF account is eligible for a tax deduction, it helps in tax savings. Employer's share is exempted from tax. Such exemption can be availed up to a specific limit.</li>
                    <li><strong>Easy Premature Withdrawal:</strong> Members of EPF can initiate a withdrawal for benefits or partial withdrawal. Various situations, like education, marriage, or illness, allow for partial withdrawal. In case the EPF account remains inactive for a period higher than the specified duration, the balance can be withdrawn as per the rules.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>EPF Withdrawal Rules</h2>
                <p>Individuals may not enter partial or complete withdrawal of EPF. But, such withdrawals can be made only under specific circumstances.</p>

                    <li>When an individual wants to switch to or be self-employed. (But the duration without a job should be more than two months.)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Here is a list of a few such circumstances under which individuals can withdraw EPF partially:</p>
