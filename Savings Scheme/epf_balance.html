                <h1>EPF Balance</h1>
                <p>Employee Provident Fund (EPF) is a fund in which a portion of your salary gets deposited every month for the purpose of long-term savings.</p>
                <h2>What is EPF Balance?</h2>
                <p>EPF balance is the total amount of your salary that is deposited in the EPF account, under your name, on a particular date. Each month, a fraction of your salary is deposited into this retirement savings fund.</p>
                <h2>How to Check EPF Balance?</h2>
                <p>Following are the ways to check the EPF balance:</p>
                <h3>1) Find EPF Balance Through EPFO Portal/UAN Number</h3>

                </ul>

                <ul>
                    <li>Note that an employee's Aadhaar Card, PAN, and bank account number must be certainly linked with the UAN.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>4) EPF Balance Enquiry with Unregistered Mobile Number</h3>

                </ul>
                <h3>5) EPF Balance Check Through SMS Service</h3>
                <p>If employees have activated their UAN, they can do the balance check on mobile number and online by sending an SMS to 7738299899.</p>
                <div class="disclaimer">The format is SMS - EPFOHO UAN ENG. Note the last three letters are the preferred language in which the employee would like to obtain the details.</div>
                <p>This facility is available in Marathi, Bengali, Kannada, Malayalam, Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, Gujarati, Punjabi, and English. Also, for availing of these services, the Aadhaar, PAN, and bank details of the employee are required to be linked to the UAN.</p>
                <h2>EPF Deductions</h2>
                <p>The amount in your EPF balance will be determined on the basis of what percentage of your salary is deducted each month.</p>
                <p>Under the Provident Fund scheme, the employee, as well as the employer, contributes 12% of the employee's basic salary (plus dearness allowance, if any) into the employee's EPF account.</p>
                <p>The full 12% of the employee's contribution goes into his/her EPF account. Additionally, 3.67% (out of 12%) of the employer's contribution also goes into your EPF.</p>
                <p>The remaining 8.33% of your employer's contribution is credited to your EPS (Employee's Pension Scheme). It is important to note that EPS is different from EPF.</p>
                <h2>What is the Tax Structure on EPF Balance?</h2>
                <p>The employer contribution to the EPF is tax-free. As far as the employee's contribution to EPF is concerned, the employee can take the benefit of tax deduction under <a href="#">Section 80C</a> of the Income Tax Act.</p>
                <p>Simply put, for the employee, investment in EPF, the amount earned on the EPF balance, and the money withdrawn after the mandatory specified period (5 years) are all absolutely tax free.</p>
