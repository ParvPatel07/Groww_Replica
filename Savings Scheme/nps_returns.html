                <h1>NPS Returns</h1>
                <p>NPS, or National Pension Scheme, is a contribution based pension plan launched by the Government of India. It is regulated and administered by PFRDA under the PFRDA Act 2013. NPS is a voluntary retirement saving scheme that aims to provide retirement income to all Indian citizens and instill the habit of saving for retirement amongst the residents.</p>
                 <p>The returns from NPS are market-linked and depend on the performance of the assets invested in. Here, we provide an overview of NPS return rates for different schemes and time periods.</p>

                <h2>Who Should Invest in NPS?</h2>
                <p>The National Pension Scheme is available for every Indian citizen who wants to build a retirement corpus. NPS is suitable for individuals who are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Between the age of 18 and 60 years.</li>
                    <li>Looking for a long-term investment option for retirement planning.</li>
                    <li>Willing to invest regularly to build a retirement corpus.</li>
                    <li>Looking for tax benefits on their investments.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>It is ideal for individuals who want to ensure a source of regular income post retirement, yet to put him/her at risk. NPS is a market-linked scheme, and the returns are not guaranteed. However, the scheme offers flexibility in terms of investment options and allows individuals to choose their preferred asset allocation and fund manager.</p>

                <h2>Features and Benefits Offered by the National Pension Scheme</h2>

                <h3>Tax Exemption</h3>
                 <p>Individuals who invest in the National Pension Scheme can avail tax benefits under various sections of the Income Tax Act, 1961.</p>
                 <ul>
                     <li>Tax exemption is offered on the amount of contribution made to the NPS Tier I account, up to a certain limit.</li>
                     <li>The scheme also offers tax exemption on the partial withdrawal amount, subject to certain conditions.</li>
                 </ul>

                <h3>Returns</h3>
                <p>National Pension Scheme returns are significantly higher when compared to other long-term saving instruments like Public Provident Fund. A portion of the invested amount goes to equities, allowing NPS to outperform other forms of investment options.</p>

                 <p>National Pension Scheme has been in effect for more than 10 years and has delivered a steady 8% to 10% return every year since its inception. Moreover, one can also change their fund manager if they want a different investment portfolio for their funds.</p>

                <p>The National Pension Scheme offers either auto or active choice for the investment. The auto choice assesses an investor's age and calculates the risk portfolio automatically. For example, an investor nearing his or her retirement would prefer safe risky options that provide assured returns, whereas younger investors can utilize options which come with higher returns. The NPS allows the individual investor to select investment options and split their funds accordingly in order to gain excellent returns.</p>
                 <p>Despite the higher earning potential, the associated risk is significantly low as the equity exposure is capped at 50% to 75% for all NPS return rates. Moreover, the equity portion reduces by 2.5% every year once an investor crosses 50 years of age. That safeguards the funds from market volatility and stabilizes the risk return equation to assist an investor.</p>

                <h3>Simple Exit Rules</h3>
                <p>National Pension Scheme allows an investor to continue investing until he or she attains 60 years of age, post which they will be eligible to withdraw the entire corpus of their investment.</p>
                <p>Every investor is obligated to maintain at least 40% of the total invested corpus in the NPS fund to avail a regular pension after their retirement. However, one is eligible to withdraw 20% of the total corpus for certain purposes after they have invested in the pension fund for a minimum of 3 years.</p>
                 <p>There can be a total of 3 withdrawals made throughout the investment tenure, each within a minimum gap of 5 years. An individual can withdraw funds to pay for medical requirements for themselves or for dependents, to build or purchase a house, or to pay for their children's higher education.</p>

                <h2>Step by Step Process to Open an NPS Account</h2>
                <p>A National Pension Scheme account can be opened following both the online and offline application processes.</p>

                <h3>Offline Process</h3>
                <p>One can visit any PFRDA-approved financial institution to complete the pen and paper method of opening an NPS account. The applicant will have to submit a subscriber form from the point of contact (PoP) and follow the KYC guidelines to complete the registration process.</p>
                <p>Once the registration is completed, they will have to make the initial investment, post which a Permanent Retirement Account Number will be generated. This unique number and a password provided along with it will allow you to check up on the status of your account and NPS account online.</p>

                <h3>Online Process</h3>
                <p>In case an applicant opts for the online process, he or she will have to navigate to the official website of the National Pension Scheme and link their PAN, Aadhaar, or phone number to their profile on the service. Once registration is complete, an OTP will be sent to the provided mobile number, which will be used to generate the Permanent Retirement Account Number.</p>

                <p>A considerably high NPS return rate and assured returns make the National Pension Scheme one of the most trusted investment options for retired individuals in India. It is a flexible investment option for both risk-averse as well as aggressive individuals, helping them create a substantial corpus to utilize post retirement.</p>
                 <p>Being available to every Indian citizen, albeit on a voluntary basis, it holds immense value to every public and private sector employee who seeks a regular pension after they retire.</p>
