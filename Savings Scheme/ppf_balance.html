                <h1>PPF Balance</h1>
                <p>To keep track of interest accumulation on their PPF account, it is crucial for the concerned person to contact a bank representative or a post office official.</p>

                <h2>Reasons to Check PPF Account Balance</h2>
                <p>Individuals are imparted with crucial pieces of information when they contact a bank or a post office representative regarding their PPF account balance. Some of the reasons to check are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Keeping track of the balance: The PPF accounts allow individuals to keep track of the interest earned on their investment and make sure that the PPF balance is accurate. This is particularly important as the interest calculation is done annually on the lowest balance between the 5th and the end of the month. This interest earned is credited to an individual's PPF account after each financial year.</li>
                    <li>Growing the balance periodically allows individuals to gauge the output they will acquire at the time of their account's maturity.</li>
                    <li>PPF accounts also allow partial withdrawals of funds after the 5th year of investment. Thus, if an individual chooses to make a partial withdrawal, they should be aware of their PPF balance to determine how much they can withdraw while adhering to the scheme's rules.</li>
                    <li>PPF also provides loan against investment facility between the 3rd and 5th year of its tenure. Individuals can take a loan up to 25% of the balance available at the end of the second year preceding the loan application year. To know the quantum of loan they can avail, individuals will need to keep track of their PPF balance.</li>
                </ul>

                    <li>They will then have to log in to the PPF account portal of their respective bank using their username and password.</li>
                    <li>After logging in, they will find the details related to their PPF account and savings accounts.</li>
                    <li>Individuals who need to extract the PPF account balance and can easily check their account balance from there.</li>

                <h3>How to Check Account Balance for PPF Offline?</h3>
                <p>To check their PPF account status offline, individuals have to visit the nearest branch of the bank or post office where they have opened their account. But before doing so, there are a few pertinent details that need taking care of. These details are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Whenever anyone opens a PPF account with a bank, they are provided with a passbook. This passbook has all the details regarding one's PPF account number, PPF account balance, bank branch details, account transactions, etc.</li>
                    <li>Individuals can get his or her passbook updated from their nearest bank branch while enquiring about their account balance.</li>
                    <li>Once the passbook is updated, it will reflect the details of the individual's PPF account transactions and his or her current account balance.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>How to Check PPF Account Balance Through the Post Office?</h3>
                <p>Individuals residing in remote areas of the country without proper banking facilities can check their PPF account balance from the post office with which they have opened their accounts. The process of checking the account balance from the post office again involves updating the passbook which they have been provided with.</p>

                <h2>What are the Options Available to Individuals on their PPF's Maturity?</h2>
                <p>Another important aspect for individuals to check their account balance is to formulate financial plans for the future. People with their accumulated corpus can opt to either withdraw the entire amount or extend their PPF account tenure beyond the mandatory 15 years.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Withdraw the entire accumulated amount: With this option, an individual can withdraw the entire corpus at maturity, which is after the end of 15 years. With this option, individuals don't need to add any additional amount to their existing corpus. Also, under PPF rules 2022, this is the default treatment of an account if an individual does not choose to take any action after the 15 years are completed. The entire withdrawal amount, including the interest earned, is tax-exempted under Section 80C and Section 10(11).</li>
                    <li>Extend the PPF Account with a contribution: With this option, an individual can choose to extend their PPF account for a block of 5 years at a time, with continued contributions. This option is suitable for individuals who wish to continue saving and earning interest on their PPF corpus.</li>
                    <li>Extend the PPF Account without a contribution: With this option, an individual can choose to extend their PPF account for a block of 5 years at a time, without making any further contributions. The existing corpus will continue to earn interest, and the individual can make partial withdrawals if needed.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>How Can One Build a Good Corpus in their PPF Account?</h2>
                <p>To increase their savings corpus, individuals can adopt the following methods for their PPF:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>One can increase the corpus in their PPF account by investing regularly. They can also opt for auto-debit facilities from their bank to transfer their funds regularly to their PPF account.</li>
                    <li>They can also invest a lumpsum amount at the beginning of each financial year to maximize the interest earned, as interest is calculated on the lowest balance between the 5th and the end of the month.</li>
                </ul>
