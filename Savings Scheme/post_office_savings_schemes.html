                <h1>Post Office Saving Schemes</h1>
                <p>Post Office Saving Schemes are one of the oldest investment options in India which started way back during the British era in October 1882. They are currently run by the Government of India (GoI) and are also promoted by many of the other financial institutions like Public, Private, and Cooperative sectors in areas covering Banking, Insurance & Investments.</p>
                <p>The biggest advantage of these schemes is their sovereign guarantee i.e., it is backed by the government. Some of the popular schemes are Post Office Savings Account, National Savings Recurring Deposit Account, National Savings Time Deposit Account, National Savings Monthly Income Account, Senior Citizen Savings Scheme, Public Provident Fund, National Savings Certificates, Kisan Vikas Patra, and Sukanya Samriddhi Yojana. All of these schemes are offered at all 1.5 lakh+ post offices in India, making them accessible to everyone.</p>
                <p>Below is a list of all Post Office saving schemes with their applicable interest rates.</p>
