                <h1>EPF Interest Rate</h1>
                <p>Employee Provident Fund (EPF) is a long-term retirement savings scheme in India. The interest rate on EPF is declared annually by the Employees' Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) in consultation with the Ministry of Finance.</p>
                <p>This scheme is managed by the Employee Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO).</p>
                <p>This scheme provides a lump sum amount after retirement along with interest. Interest accrues on the deposits and is calculated on a monthly basis, compounded annually. The interest earned is tax-free.</p>
                <p>This principal amount and the accrued amount after retirement is free from income tax. Withdrawals are also tax-exempt under certain conditions.</p>
                <p>The scheme covers all entities with 20 or more employees, and both employee and employer entities are covered, subject to certain conditions and exemptions.</p>
                <h2>How To Find Out EPF Interest Rate</h2>
                <h3>Current & Historical EPF Interest Rates</h3>
                <p>The interest rate on EPF is reviewed annually. After consultation with the Ministry of Finance, the EPFO's Central Board of Trustees (CBT) declares the rate of interest for each financial year. Here are the interest rates for the past few years:</p>

                <h2>EPF Interest Rates 2023-24</h2>
                <p>The interest rate on EPF is announced on a yearly basis. The CBT proposes the interest rate for the financial year 2023-24 at 8.15%. Once the EPFO announces the interest rate for a financial year and the year closes, the interest rate is computed by the EPFO on a yearly basis and credited to the member's account.</p>
                <p>The new interest rates are published towards the end of the financial year. The interest rate is computed as a percentage of the total amount in the EPF account.</p>
                <p>Here are a few key points about EPF interest:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The interest rate of 8.15% is applicable for the financial year 2023-24.</li>
                    <li>Interest is calculated on a monthly basis, but credited annually at the end of the financial year.</li>
                    <li>Interest is computed on the closing balance of the previous month and the contributions made during the current month.</li>
                    <li>If contributions are made to an EPF account for 36 months or more, the account becomes dormant and does not earn interest.</li>
                    <li>Employees who have not activated their UAN might not earn interest on their account.</li>
                    <li>Interest is not earned on accounts of individuals who have left their organization.</li>
                    <li>The interest is calculated and credited based on the members' share.</li>
                    <li>The employee will not receive any interest for payments made by the company to the Employees' Pension Scheme (EPS).</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>EPF Contribution by Employee and Employer</h2>
                <p>Depending on the entity contributing towards EPF, there are two components of the contribution: employee and employer contribution.</p>
                <p>The employee contributes 12% of basic salary plus dearness allowance (DA) towards the EPF account. The employee contribution cannot be lower than 12%, but can be higher. The employer also contributes 12% of basic salary plus DA to the EPF.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The employer contribution includes 3.67% to the employee's EPF account and 8.33% to the employee's EPS account.</li>
                    <li>For example, if the salary is ₹20,000, the employee contributes ₹2,400 (12% of ₹20,000) to the EPF.</li>
                    <li>The employer contributes ₹2,400 (12% of ₹20,000) as well, with ₹734 (3.67% of ₹20,000) going to the EPF and ₹1,666 (8.33% of ₹20,000) going to the EPS.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>How to Calculate PF Interest</h2>
                <p>Every month, the interest is calculated based on the monthly running balance in the EPF account. The interest for the year is calculated at the declared annual rate and is credited at the end of the financial year.</p>
                <p>For example, if the EPF interest rate for 2023-24 is 8.15%, the interest applicable per month is 8.15% / 12 = 0.6791666%. This monthly interest rate is applied to the monthly running balance.</p>
                <p>Assuming an employee joined on 1 April 2023 with a basic salary of ₹20,000, contributions start from April 2023. Total EPF contribution for April is ₹4,800 (₹2,400 from employee + ₹2,400 from employer's EPF share). Interest for April is 0 as it's the first month.</p>
                <p>EPF account balance at the end of April: ₹4,800.</p>
                <p>EPF contribution for May: ₹4,800. Total EPF account balance as of May: ₹4,800 (April) + ₹4,800 (May) = ₹9,600.</p>
                <p>Interest on the EPF contribution for May: ₹9,600 * 0.6791666% = ₹65.2.</p>
                <p>This calculation continues each month, and the total interest for the year is the sum of the monthly interest calculations, credited at the end of the financial year.</p>
