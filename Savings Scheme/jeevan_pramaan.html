                <h1>Jeevan Pramaan</h1>
                <p>To encourage financial independence after retirement, the Government introduced various sponsored pension schemes. A key initiative is the Jeevan Pramaan, a digital service that allows pensioners to furnish a Life Certificate to the institution that is authorized to disburse pension into their account.</p>

                <p>Such a life certificate serves as proof of their existence for receiving a pension. Earlier the process of availing a life certificate involved physically visiting the disbursing authority or getting it attested by an authorized person and submitting. To eliminate the hassles that come with pension disbursement, the government of India digitised the process and launched the Jeevan Pramaan service for pensioners.</p>

                <h2>What is the Jeevan Pramaan Certificate?</h2>
                <p>Jeevan Pramaan Certificate is the Digital Life Certificate of The Government of India's Pension Scheme in Aadhaar enabled biometric authentication based digital service. It is a facility for pensioners to get their Digital Life Certificate instead of submitting a physical Life Certificate to the Pension Disbursing Agency.</p>

                <p>Jeevan Pramaan is the Digital Life Certificate for Pensioners issued under the Aadhaar-enabled biometric authentication system by the Government of India. This certificate serves as proof of existence for pensioners and facilitates the seamless disbursement of their pension. It eliminates the need for pensioners to physically visit the pension disbursing authority.</p>

                <h2>How does Jeevan Pramaan Work?</h2>
                <p>Jeevan Pramaan Certificate being a digital service utilizes the Aadhaar platform for pensioners to be physically present at a certification authority or disbursement agency. It uses the Aadhaar platform to flag off the process of generating the Digital Life Certificate for Pensioners by facilitating biometric authentication. The pensioner can either provide his/her fingerprint or iris and avail an authentication process, and can also locate a nearby centre through the website.</p>

                <p>Once the authentication is completed, pension disbursing agencies can directly access a pensioner's Life Certificate at the Life Certificate Repository, where it was securely stored after the completion of the process. Individuals will only have to mention their Jeevan Pramaan ID. This simplifies the process for pensioners and eliminates the need for physical submission of life certificates.</p>

                <p>Jeevan Pramaan Life Certificate leverages the Life Certificate Repository. Both pensioners and disbursement agencies can access the digital life certificate easily at any point of time from anywhere. Jeevan Pramaan centres can be found at various locations, including government offices, banks, and post offices. Additionally, you can use the 'centre locator' on the Jeevan Pramaan website to locate a centre that is convenient for you.</p>
