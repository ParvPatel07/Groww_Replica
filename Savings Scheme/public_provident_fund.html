                <h2>What is PPF?</h2>
                <p>PPF account can be simply coined as a long-term investment scheme popular among individuals who wish to earn risk-free returns while retaining the safety of the principal amount. It is to be noted that the principal amount invested in a provident fund scheme and their aggregate income, however, is not quite beneficial in terms of tax savings.</p>

                <h2>Importance of a PPF Account</h2>
                <p>A Public provident fund scheme is ideal for individuals with a low-risk appetite. Since this plan is mandated by the government, it is backed up with guaranteed returns to protect the financial needs of the investors and their families. Further, investors can also avail income tax benefits under the Section 80C of the Income Tax Act.</p>
                <p>Investors can also undertake the public provident fund regime to diversify their financial and investment portfolio. At times of downsizing of the business cycle, PPF accounts can provide stable returns on investment annually.</p>

                <h2>Features of a PPF Account</h2>

                        <p>The interest payable on public provident fund schemes is determined by the Central Government of India. It aims to provide higher interest than regular accounts maintained by various commercial banks in the country.</p>

                    </li>

                <h2>How to Open a PPF Account?</h2>
                <p>Both offline and online procedures are available for an individual provident fund scheme. Mostly, people partake in the online eligibility criteria. Activating PPF online can be done by visiting the portal of a chosen bank or post office.</p>

                <h3>Documents Required to Apply for PPF</h3>

It should be kept in mind that the total principal that can be invested in one financial year should not exceed Rs. 1.5 Lakh.</p>
                <p>The total interest accrued on PPF investment is also exempt from any tax calculations.</p>
                <p>Therefore, the entire amount redeemed from a PPF account upon completion of maturity is not subject to taxation. This policy makes the public provident fund scheme attractive to many investors in India.</p>

                <p>Mandatory lock-in of 15 years is imposed on the principal amount invested in such plans. In case of emergencies, investors can make partial withdrawals from the PPF account. Notably, they can only withdraw funds after the completion of 5 years of activation of the account. Up to 50% of the total balance can be withdrawn in one transaction each financial year succeeding the 4th year.</p>
                <p>Investors should note that funds invested in a PPF account cannot be liquidated before the completion of the mandatory lock-in period, except during certain risks. Also, investment options providing stable policies can easily opt for this government-backed instrument.</p>
