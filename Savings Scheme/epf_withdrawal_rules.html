                <h1>EPF or PF Withdrawal Rules</h1>
                <p>EPF or Provident Fund, is a contribution-based savings scheme where both the employee and the employer contribute a part of the employee's salary every month. The accumulated fund can be accessed or withdrawn by the employee subject to certain Provident Fund withdrawal rules.</p>
                <p>The Employee Provident Fund in India is administered by a statutory body, Employees' Provident Fund Organisation, under the Employees' Provident Funds and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1952.</p>

                <h2>Withdrawal of Provident Fund</h2>
                <p>PF is meant to be withdrawn after an individual's retirement. However, there are certain <strong>Provident Fund withdrawal rules</strong> that allow an individual to partially withdraw the sum for emergency purposes.</p>
                <p>Account holders can make three different types of PF withdrawals, namely,</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>PF partial withdrawal,</li>
                    <li>PF total withdrawal,</li>
                    <li>PF account closure.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>An individual can withdraw a partial amount from his or her <a href="#">employee provident fund</a> account before its maturity (except in the case of unemployment) under certain situations.</p>
                <p>Here are some of the circumstances that allow an individual to partially withdraw the sum.</p>

                <h2>EPF Withdrawal Rules 2025</h2>
                <p>Here are some of the basic rules that one must take note of:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>One can withdraw up to 75% of the funds if unemployed for at least 1 month. And the balance amount if they are unemployed for 2 months or more.</li>
                    <li>You can also partially withdraw by submitting Form 31.</li>
                    <li>If an individual intends to withdraw Rs. 50,000 or more amount from the corpus within 5 years of opening the EPF account, it will be liable for tax deduction at source. However, TDS is not applicable if one submits PAN Card.</li>
                    <li>One can avail of a loan against the PF savings only when the firm is not in service for a certain number of years.</li>
                    <li>Also, if an individual requires to withdraw a lump sum from his/her service for any reason such as changing jobs. The maturity can easily be transferred if your UAN is active and relevant forms have been submitted.</li>
                    <li>One can withdraw the full PF balance if he/she has been unemployed for at least 2 months or after the joining of a new company for a period of 1 month after the date of leaving the previous company.</li>
                </ol>

                <h2>Common Reasons for Provident Fund Withdrawal with Applicable PF Withdrawal Rules</h2>
                <p>Here are some reasons for PF withdrawal, along with the applicable rules for each case:-</p>

                <h3>In Case of Unemployment</h3>
                <p>A PF account holder can withdraw up to 75% of the total accumulated amount if he/she has been unemployed for one month. If the unemployment period extends to two months or more, then the account holder will be allowed to withdraw the remaining 25% if the unemployment period stretches over 2 months.</p>

                <h3>For Education</h3>
                <p>An account holder can withdraw up to 50% of the total employee's contribution to EPF to pay for their higher education or their children's education or marriage expenses. This withdrawal is allowed only after completing 7 years of service.</p>
                <p>The funds will be withdrawable after completing a minimum of 7 years towards the EPF account.</p>

                <h3>To Pay for Marriage</h3>
                <p>To meet PF withdrawal rules also allow an account holder to withdraw up to 50% of the employee's share to pay for marriage expenses of self, son, or daughter.</p>
                <p>This marriage should be of the individual, son/daughter, or the account holder's sister, daughter, father, or mother. However, this provision can be utilized only after the completion of 7 years of PF contribution.</p>

                <h3>For Specially-abled Individuals</h3>
                <p>Under the PF withdrawal rules 2025, specially-abled account holders can withdraw 6 months' basic wage along with dearness allowance, or the employee's share whichever is less, to purchase equipment for their disability.</p>
                <p>This decision was made to help ease the financial burden individuals might experience to purchase expensive equipment.</p>

                <h3>For Medical Emergencies</h3>
                <p>A PF or EPF account holder can also withdraw the EPF balance to pay for urgent medical treatments for certain diseases. This facility is allowed for both self-usage or to pay for treatment of immediate family members.</p>
                <p>One can withdraw 6 months' basic wage and dearness allowance, or the employee share whichever is less.</p>

                <h3>To Pay for Existing Debts</h3>
                <p>Individuals can withdraw 36 months of basic wage + dearness allowance, or the employee share whichever is less, to pay for existing debts like home loan, personal loan, etc.</p>
                <p>However, this facility is available only after the completion of 10 years' contribution towards the EPF account.</p>

                <h3>To Purchase Residential Property or Land Plate</h3>
                <p>According to PF withdrawal rules, the account holder is allowed to make a lump sum withdrawal to purchase empty land or pre-fabricated houses.</p>
                <p>EPFO has also provided a PF withdrawal limit for this purpose, for example:</p>

                    <tbody>
                        <tr>
                            <td>24 month's basic wage and Dearness Allowance</td>
                            <td>The accumulated funds from the EPF account, along with the employee and employer's share.</td>

                        </tr>

                            <td>36 month's basic wage and Dearness Allowance</td>
                            <td>The accumulated funds along with the total employee and employer share.</td>
                            <td>To purchase or construct a residential property or a plot.</td>
                        </tr>
                         <tr>
                            <td>12 month's basic wage and Dearness Allowance</td>
                            <td>The accumulated funds along with the total employee and employer share.</td>
                            <td>For home renovation.</td>
                        </tr>
                    </tbody>
                </table>
                 <p>Provident fund new rules also come with a provision to withdraw the 12 month's basic wage plus Dearness Allowance, as well as the employer's share with dearness allowance is available for home renovation, improvement, or expansion.</p>
                 <p>Such withdrawal can be availed only if the property is registered by the or in the spouse's or joint name's.</p>
                 <p>An individual can use this facility 2 times, after after 5 years of completing the residential property, and after 10 years can withdraw PF amount for the first time.</p>
                 <p>Recent EPF withdrawal rules also allow an account holder to withdraw up to 90% of the accumulated funds after attaining the age of 54 years or within one year before retirement.</p>
                 <p>Also, in case of the sudden demise of an employee (while he or she is still in service), their nominee/beneficiary can apply for a pension (under EPS) or a monthly pension (Form 10D).</p>
                 <p>These withdrawal rules provide adequate flexibility to allow an individual to cater to various emergency requirements using their savings.</p>
                 <p>One can also choose to invest in other high return investment options, like Mutual Funds, if they have surplus funds after meeting their financial obligations.</p>
                 <p>These investment options offer a higher return than traditional savings schemes, while still being Mutual Funds can also provide tax benefits under certain conditions.</p>


                <h2>Steps to Enter Exit and Withdraw PF</h2>
                <p>If your Provident Fund (PF) withdrawal is being delayed, it could be because the exit date has not been updated. To avoid this, the Employees' Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) has created a feature on the Unified Portal where the employee can update their exit date. This process requires the employer to approve the exit date. The employee could enter the exit date, but now employees can do so as well.</p>
                <p>By logging into the Unified Portal with your UAN and password, you can update your exit date. The facility is located under the 'Service' menu. The exit date is limited by clicking on 'Service History' at the top panel under 'View'.</p>
                <p>The following are the steps you must take in order to enter the Exit Date:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Enter your unified Account Number and Password to access your UAN site.</li>
                    <li>Go to the 'View' section and click on 'Service History,' which is found beneath it.</li>
                    <li>Select the employer from the drop-down menu.</li>
                </ul>
                 <p>You will be taken to a new page where you must sign your birth-date, date of joining, and date of exit. If your exit date is blank at the bottom of the page, you must click on the calendar icon.</p>

                 <table class="interval-table">

                </table>

                <h2>Documents Required for EPF Withdrawal</h2>
                <p>The following listed documents are required to withdraw PF amount:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Universal Account Number (UAN)</li>
                    <li>Identity and address proof</li>
                    <li>Bank account information of the EPF subscriber</li>
                    <li>Cancelled cheque with IFSC code and account number</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Grievance Portal of PF Withdrawal</h2>
                <p>If you have a complaint about the EPFO's services, you can file it online through the EPF grievance handling system. This system allows you to track the status of your complaint, upload relevant documents, and receive notifications. You can access the portal through the EPFO website.</p>

                <h2>Lowering Tax Burden on EPF Withdrawal</h2>
                <p>Individuals can also decrease their tax liability by smart withdrawal of their PF amount. Usually, withdrawals are liable for TDS.</p>
                <p>But, according to the revised EPF withdrawal rules 2025, withdrawal of funds after a minimum of 5 years of service is tax-free.</p>
                <p>Employee's Provident Fund was always an attractive savings scheme, with the facility to transfer one's EPF account with a UAN number, and with the provision to earn interest on the balance fund for up to 3 years without any contribution.</p>
                <p>The new withdrawal rules have made the system even more beneficial for individuals working in the organized sector, by providing more flexibility in terms of withdrawal.</p>
