                <h1>National Pension Scheme (NPS)</h1>
                <p>NPS full form stands for National Pension Scheme. NPS is an initiative undertaken by the Government of India with the goal of encouraging all residents to save towards retirement. NPS aims to inculcate the habit of saving for retirement amongst the residents.</p>
                <p>Here, we will cover the objectives of NPS, types of NPS accounts, interest rates and benefits. Before that, let us first look at the purpose of the NPS scheme in India.</p>
                <p>What is the purpose of NPS Scheme India?</p>
                <p>The purpose of the NPS scheme is to provide financial security to individuals after retirement. It is a long-term investment plan that encourages individuals to save regularly throughout their working life to build a substantial corpus for their retirement.</p>

                <h2>What is National Pension Scheme?</h2>
                <p>Regulated and administered by the PFRDA or Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority under the PFRDA Act 2013, NPS is a voluntary, defined contribution scheme that is market linked and managed by professional fund managers.</p>
                <p>Under NPS, individual savings are pooled in a pension fund which is invested by PFRDA registered professional fund managers into diversified portfolios comprising Government Bonds, G-Secs, Corporate Debentures, and Shares.</p>
                <p>Contributions made by individual subscribers to the National Pension Scheme under this system are accumulated until retirement. A portion of the accumulated corpus can be withdrawn as a lump sum payment at the time of retirement or opting for superannuation. However, this scheme ensures that a part of savings is utilized to purchase an annuity plan for regular pension post retirement.</p>
                <p>Thus, at retirement, or at superannuation, at least 40% of the contribution is utilized for the procurement of a lifetime pension via the purchase of an annuity. The remaining funds are paid to the subscriber in a lump sum.</p>

                <h2>How to Apply for NPS Account</h2>
                <p>Here's how to open a National Pension Scheme online and offline:</p>

                <h3>How to Open NPS Account Online</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Individuals can register and obtain a subscription to the National Pension System through the online platform of NPS. Eligible for the scheme can be done at the following steps:</li>
                    <li>Step 1 - Go to the NPS website and select the 'Online Subscriber Registration' option.</li>
                    <li>Step 2 - Choose your subscriber type from the available options: 'Individual Subscriber' and 'Corporate Subscriber'.</li>
                    <li>Step 3 - Choose your residential status: 'Indian Citizen' or 'NRI'.</li>
                    <li>Step 4 - Opt for either Tier I account type or both accounts, as the former is mandatory for long-term savings.</li>
                    <li>Step 5 - Enter your PAN details and select a suitable bank or PoP. It is ideal to choose a PoP with whom you have an existing relationship, such as a savings/current/demat account for KYC verification, as the chosen PoP will do it.</li>
                    <li>Step 6 - Upload the scanned copy of your PAN card along with a cancelled cheque. The image format should be in .jpeg or .jpg and should not exceed 2 MB.</li>
                    <li>Step 7 - Next, upload your scanned photograph and signature in the same format and size as above.</li>
                    <li>Step 8 - Once routed to the payment gateway, proceed to pay the required charges via Net Banking.</li>
                    <li>Step 9 - With the completion of payment, your Permanent Retirement Account Number will be generated.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>How to Apply for NPS Account Offline</h3>
                <p>To open an NPS account offline or manually, you must first locate a PoP - Point of Presence (which might be a bank), register yourself, and fulfil KYC requirements. You will then receive a PRAN - Permanent Retirement Account Number - once you make the initial contribution (not less than Rs. 500), Rs.1000 monthly, or Rs.1,000 annually).</p>
                 <p>This number, along with the password in your sealed welcome kit, will assist you in operating your account. This information also helps in tracking the account online.</p>

                <h2>How to Log in to the NPS Account</h2>
                <p>After your NPS account is created and PRAN is allocated, log in to your E-NPS account through various mediums, such as the NSDL NPS portal, the KFintech portal or net banking account.</p>

                    <thead>
                        <tr>

                        </tr>
                         <tr>
                            <td>U/S 80CCD (2)</td>
                            <td>Contribution of an employee towards Tier I investments is eligible for deduction up to 10% for central government contributions and up to 14% for others. This deduction is over and above the deduction limit applicable u/s 80C.</td>

                    </tbody>
                </table>

                <p>The National Pension Scheme Details has other tax benefits on NPS Tier I investments including -</p>
                 <ul>
                     <li>Up to 20% of Tier I contributions withdrawn by a subscriber are exempt from tax.</li>
                     <li>Annuity purchase from the National Pension Scheme corpus is tax-exempt. However, income generated from such an annuity in the following years is taxable.</li>
                     <li>Lump-sum withdrawal of up to 60% of an NPS corpus after a subscriber turns 60 is exempt from tax.</li>
                 </ul>
                 <p>Thus, after 60 years of age, if the total corpus created through the National Pension System amounts to Rs. 20 Lakh, a lump sum withdrawal of 60%, i.e., Rs.12 Lakh, will not attract any tax.</p>
                 <p>Further, if you utilise the remaining 40% of funds for annuity purchase, the entire corpus will be tax-free. Only the income generated from the annuity will be taxable.</p>
