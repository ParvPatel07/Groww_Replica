                <h1>National Savings Certificate (NSC)</h1>
                <p>National Savings Certificate (NSC) is a fixed-income investment scheme that is part of the Indian Government's postal savings system. It is a popular choice for individuals looking for a safe investment option with tax benefits.</p>

                <h2>What is National Savings Certificate</h2>
                <p>National Savings Certificate is a savings bond scheme that encourages subscribers, primarily small to mid income investors, to save while saving up on income tax under Section 80C.</p>
                <p>Features and benefits of NSC include tax benefits, fixed interest rates, and safety of principal. These certificates can be purchased from any post office in India.</p>

                <h2>Features & Benefits of NSC</h2>
                <p>Here are some of the key features of NSC scheme:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Interest Rates:</strong> The certificates earn a fixed interest rate, which is revised every quarter by the government. The current interest rate is 7.7% annually, compounded annually but payable at maturity.</li>
                    <li><strong>Maturity Period:</strong> The scheme offers two distinct maturity periods: 5 years and 10 years.</li>
                    <li><strong>Tax Saving:</strong> As a government-backed tax-saving scheme, the principal invested in NSC qualifies for tax savings under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act, 1961, up to a maximum of Rs. 1.5 Lakh per annum. The interest earned is taxable in the year of maturity.</li>
                    <li><strong>Minimum Investment:</strong> You can invest in the scheme with as low as Rs. 100 and in multiples of Rs. 100, with no upper limit on the investment amount.</li>
                    <li><strong>Accessibility:</strong> One can easily buy or pledge NSC from any post office in India. It is easy to transfer the certificate from one PO to another or even from one person to another without implying the interest accumulation of the original certificate.</li>
                    <li><strong>Loan Against NSC:</strong> NSC can be used as collateral for securing loans from banks and NBFCs. In such a case, a transfer stamp is put on the certificate and transferred to the bank while disbursing loans.</li>
                    <li><strong>Power of Compounding:</strong> Interest earned gets compounded annually and reinvested by default but will be payable only at maturity.</li>
                    <li><strong>Nomination:</strong> The investor can nominate any family member (even a minor) so that they can inherit the investment in case of the investor's demise.</li>
                    <li><strong>Encash on Maturity:</strong> The investor will receive the entire corpus at maturity. As there is no TDS on NSC payouts, the subscriber should pay the applicable tax on it while filing his income tax returns or paying the advance tax on the same.</li>
                    <li><strong>Premature Withdrawal:</strong> Generally, one cannot exit the scheme early except on the death of an investor, or a court order, or on forfeiture by a pledgee who is a Gazetted Government Officer for it.</li>
                </ul>
