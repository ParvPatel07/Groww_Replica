                <h1>EPF Form 19</h1>
                <p>Under the Employees' Provident Funds and Miscellaneous Provisions Act 1952, an employee has to make 10 specific contributions to their Provident Fund each month. The employer has to match half of this amount paid by the employee. Withdrawal under the scheme requires an EPFO member to fill up a handful of forms, PF Form 19 being one.</p>

                <h2>What is PF Form 19?</h2>
                <p>PF Form 19 has to be filled when a member wants to go for a final settlement of his/her PF account. It is only applicable when a member is unemployed for a continuous period of one month or more. The member must also have a UAN, and the member will only have to mention his/her PF account number. This form will be used to claim a final settlement of the accumulated corpus.</p>

                <p>There are various types of PF Forms available, serving different purposes. These forms have to be duly filled and then submitted to the EPFO to get the desired outcome. All forms are available on the EPFO or Employees' Provident Fund Organization website. The different types of PF forms and their purposes are mentioned here:</p>

                <h2>Who Should Fill PF Form 19?</h2>
                <p>Only individuals who have retired or stopped employment holding a provident fund account. The form is used only for withdrawing <a href="#">EPF</a> amount at the time of retirement or when an employee quits.</p>
                <p>Also, if an employee quits a job, he/she will have to be unemployed for at least two months to utilize this form for withdrawing the amount. The employee is eligible to claim and withdraw the amount if they have stopped working for more than 2 months. For those who have stopped working for less than 2 months, they can only withdraw the employee's share, and that too after getting an attestation from a gazetted officer or manager.</p>
                 <p>Individuals who have stopped working for more than 2 months can withdraw their entire PF amount by filling out this form. The employee is required to provide details such as their UAN, PF account number, and bank details.</p>

                <h2>What are the Details to be Filled in PF Form 19?</h2>
                <p>PF Form no 19 is a 2-page long form, and members are required to fill in the following details :</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Provident fund account number</li>
                    <li>Bank account number with IFSC code (It has to be the same account registered with one's current employer)</li>
                    <li>Joining and exit date of employment.</li>
                    <li>Address</li>
                    <li>Form 15G/15H</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Other details that a member needs to fill out include their full postal address, a preferred method of remittance (whether by cheque or direct credit), and the reason for withdrawal. It is crucial to note that one should also provide a cancelled cheque for bank account verification.</p>

                <h2>How to Fill Form 19 for PF Withdrawal?</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Login to the EPFO website with your Universal Account Number (UAN), password, and captcha.</li>
                    <li>Navigate to the 'Online Services' tab and click 'Claim (Form - 31, 19, & 10C)'.</li>
                    <li>Next, enter the last four digits of the bank account number linked with the provident fund account and click on 'Verify'.</li>
                    <li>Click on 'Yes' for the 'Certificate of Undertaking' pop-up.</li>
                    <li>Next, select 'Only PF Withdrawal (Form - 19)' from the drop-down menu under the 'I want to apply for' option.</li>
                    <li>After selecting the option, you will be asked to enter your full address and click on 'Get Aadhaar OTP'.</li>
                    <li>The OTP will be sent to your registered mobile number. Enter it to verify.</li>
                    <li>Once the submission is complete, you will receive a reference number for process completion.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>After the employer approves the request, the PF amount due will be deposited in the member's bank account.</p>

                <h2>Prerequisites of Filling Form 19</h2>
                <p>First of all, you must have registered on the EPFO member portal.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Your bank account and <a href="#">PAN</a> must be connected to your UAN.</li>
                    <li>Your mobile phone number should also be linked to your UAN.</li>
                    <li>Form 15G or 15H must be filled by individuals below 60 if you are not qualified for final settlement.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>However, if Form 19 or Form 10 (c) is present in the alternatives, Form 10C will be as well.</p>

                <h2>Benefits of PF Form 19</h2>
                <p>The online process of claims submission for provident fund withdrawal under <a href="#">PF Withdrawal</a> Form 19 does away with the requirement for employer's attestation. Also, provident fund withdrawal can be made possible up to 5 days after the application submission, provided the member's bank account must be linked with his/her UAN.</p>
                <p>This unified portal enables members to withdraw provident funds easily. Also, a single page composite claim form makes this an easy piece of a government, making public services more transparent as well as accessible for the subscribers.</p>

                <h2>Limitations of PF Form 19</h2>
                 <p>Even though employer attestation is no longer required for a member to withdraw the provident fund, the final settlement can only take place when the employer has updated the exit date of the member. If it is not updated, the provident fund department would be under the assumption that the member is still working for the employee, which can hinder the withdrawal process.</p>
                 <p>In such a situation, the member can only have access to Form 31, which is for an advance refund. It is incumbent upon the member to ensure that the employer updates the exit of service. However, the member can update the date of exit on the UAN website without employer intervention only after 2 months of employment exit.</p>

                <h2>How to Check the Claim Status</h2>
                <p>You can check the status using another method. This procedure consists of the following stages:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Navigate to the Official EPFO Unified Portal. Enter your UAN number, password, and Captcha to log in.</li>
                    <li>Then, under the 'Online Services' menu, pick 'Track Claim Status.'</li>
                    <li>You can now view the status of your claim.</li>
                </ul>
