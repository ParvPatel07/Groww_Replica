                <h1>Post Office RD Interest Rates</h1>

                <p>Besides outstanding mail services, post office offers several financial services to their customers in the form of deposits and investments. Recurring deposits are one of the most popular schemes offered by post offices. Post office recurring deposits have become the most preferred investment when compared to banks. One of the primary reasons for this is the highest interest rates offered by post offices on recurring deposits. The post office RD interest rates are regular in a proper interval and the current interest rate is 6.50% p.a. The interest is compounded quarterly which allows the money deposited to multiply. So the money term. </p>

                <h2>How to Calculate Post Office RD Returns?</h2>
                <p>The sum of interest offered on a Post office Recurring Deposit follows the compounding principles. It uses the compounding interest formula mentioned below to calculate the sum of interest.</p>
                <p>A= P Ã— [ (1+R/N)^(NT) - 1 ] / [1 - (1+R/N)^(-N/12) ]</p>
                <p>Here,</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A= Maturity Amount</li>
                    <li>P= Recurring deposit</li>
                    <li>N= Number of times that interest is compounded</li>
                    <li>R= Rate of interest</li>
                    <li>T= Tenure</li>
                </ul>
                 <p>For example,</p>
                 <p>Mr. G invests Rs. 5,000 into his RD at the rate of 7.2% p.a. for 60 months. The sum accrued at maturity would stand at:</p>
                 <p>A = 5,000[(1+0.072/4)^(4*5) - 1] / [1 - (1+0.072/4)^(-4/12)]</p>
                 <p>= Rs. 3,53,840</p>

                <h2>Components of the RD Interest Rates in Post Office</h2>
                 <p><b>Tenure</b></p>
                <p>Unlike the recurring deposit at banks, post office RD tenure is fixed, i.e. 5 years. Most people open an RD account to ensure a small monthly saving, so that a lump sum is available for them after the maturity period. The Post office RD is used as a medium-term investment option. Presently, an RD account at a Post office has a minimum tenure of 5 years, but this can be extended for another 5 years by submitting a form at the post office.</p>
                <p>If one wants to continue with the RD account even after 5 years, there is a provision for the same under which the RD can be extended to 5 more years making the maximum tenure is 10 years.</p>

                <p><b>Minimum and Maximum Deposit</b></p>
                <p>A recurring deposit is one of the most preferred investment tools to earn good returns on your monthly investment. Post office recurring deposits offer a minimum monthly deposit of Rs. 10 or more. There is no cap on the maximum amount you can deposit into the account and it can be in multiples of Rs. 5. In short, you can deposit any amount you wish to save as per the post office RD rules. This allows you to save whatsoever amount is feasible.</p>

                 <p><b>Dates of Deposit</b></p>
                <p>A post office RD requires a total of 60 deposits during the tenure, i.e. one deposit every month for 5 years. The first installment of the deposit needs to be made at the time of opening the account. All the monthly deposits are to be made on or before a particular date, depending on the date the account was opened.</p>
                <p>Coming down to the exact dates, individuals who open their account between the 1st and 15th of a month must make the monthly deposits every month by the 15th. Similarly, individuals who open their account between the 16th and the last day of a month must make their monthly deposits every month by the last day of that month. For making deposits, one can use the modes of demand draft, pay order or a cheque.</p>

                 <p><b>Penalties on Delayed RD Deposits</b></p>
                <p>A post office RD allows the account holder with a minimum of a 1 month of default, i.e., 6 grace days in case he/she fails to make the 6th monthly payment in his/her account, the account becomes inactive (Discontinued account). Such discontinued accounts can be revived within 5 years from the date of the last deposit.</p>
                <p>According to the post office RD rule, a default penalty of 5 paise is charged for every 5 rupees which are going to be deposited in the account. The bank charges this fine to be paid in addition to the previously missed deposit amount as well when the account is revived.</p>

                 <p><b>Post Office RD Rebate</b></p>
                <p>To help people in depositing money in advance, a rebate on advance deposits is provided by the post office RD. The rebates might not sum up to a big amount but can contribute to saving a considerable amount for other purposes.</p>

                <h2>Premature Withdrawal of Post Office RD</h2>
                <p>Individuals can access their Post office recurring deposit and fund their urgent requirements. But they can withdraw their RD money only after the first year of opening the account. In case, you are opting for a premature withdrawal facility, the full interest amount won't be applied on the withdrawal funds and it needs to be repaid in lump sum along with the interest applicable.</p>

                <h2>Loan Against RD</h2>
                <p>You can apply for a loan against your National Savings Recurring Deposit by completing Form C-1 to qualify for the loan amount. The loan amount should not exceed 50% of the deposit balance at the time of application. You need to furnish your RD passbook to get your loan amount or any other document required by the bank to get your loan. You can repay the loan in a lump sum or in equal payments. The account holder must repay the entire amount before the RD matures.</p>
                <p>The applicable interest rate on the loan would be 2% more than the interest rate earned on the RD account. The interest will be charged from the date of withdrawal to the date of final repayment. In proportion to the loan amount, if you fail to repay the loan, the RD will be foreclosed and the loan amount plus interest will be deducted from the RD account at maturity value. If the loan is not repaid, the loan amount will be adjusted within a longer period of time.</p>
                <p>If you do not repay the loan in full or in part, the amount owed will be recovered from your legal successor, or the nominee when the account is closed. If the interest payable on the loan exceeds the interest on the RD, the account holder must pay the difference.</p>
