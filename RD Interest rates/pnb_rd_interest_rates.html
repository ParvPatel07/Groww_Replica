                <h2>Features of PNB Recurring Deposit Scheme</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>The minimum amount needed to open a PNB RD account is as low as Rs. 100.</li>
                    <li>The tenure ranges from 180 days to 10 years.</li>
                    <li>PNB offers loan against the deposited amount of 90% interest rate as per regular interest rates.</li>
                    <li>The maximum deposit offered by the bank is for a tenure ranging from 3 years to 10 years. The rates are 5.25% for regular citizens and 5.75% for senior citizens.</li>
                    <li>PNB offers a facility of loan against the deposit amount.</li>
                    <li>TDS deductions depend on the income slab to which the applicant belongs.</li>
                    <li>PNB also offers a nomination facility so that you can nominate somebody to collect the matured amount in case of the account holder's demise.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>How to Apply for a PNB RD Account?</h2>
                <p>There are two methods to apply for an RD account at PNB:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><b>Online (Net Banking)</b></li>
                    <li><b>Offline (Visiting the Branch)</b></li>
                </ol>
                <p><b>Online:</b> This is for existing customers of Punjab National Bank, they can use their net banking username and password to log in to their online account and open an e-RD right away.</p>
                <p><b>Offline:</b> Those who are not PNB account holders, will have to open a PNB bank account first by visiting the nearest PNB branch. Once the account is active, one can open an e-RD by logging in to their net banking.</p>

                <h2>How to Calculate PNB RD Account Interest Rate Investment?</h2>
                <p>The formula used to calculate the total amount accumulated upon maturity is: A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt)</p>
                <p>Here:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>'A' is the final amount</li>
                    <li>'P' is the principal</li>
                    <li>'r' is the annual interest rate</li>
                    <li>'n' is the number of times that interest has been compounded.</li>
                    <li>'t' is the tenure.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Suppose, Mr. Ravi opens an RD account with a regular deposit of Rs 500 on a 6.1% for 24 months or 2 years. The applicable PNB recurring deposit interest rate on the same is 6.1%, so the total deposit amount would stand to Rs. 12000 which is less than Rs 1 Crore. Interest on the same would be Rs 813 according to the formula.</p>
                <p>Apart from getting the highest interest rates, RD in PNB is also eligible for tax benefits under the Income Tax Act of 1961. The money you invest in recurring deposit schemes is taxable under the Income Tax (TDS) at Source (TDS) of 10% is applicable on interest earned (provided, it is more than Rs. 10,000/year). For saving TDS on your RD profit, you can either fill form 15G or form 15H.</p>

                <h2>PNB RD Interest Rate Deciding Factors</h2>
                 <p>The RD maturity amount you get at the end is based on the following parameters. Alternatively, one can also use the <a href="#">PNB RD interest calculator</a> to check the answer yourself on their deposit.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Deposit Amount:</b> The total amount deposited by a customer in their account. The deposit amount for PNB RD starts from as low as Rs 100.</li>
                    <li><b>PNB Interest Rates:</b> Punjab National Bank offers a comparatively higher rate of interest on recurring deposits with longer tenure and lower interest rates for an account opened for a shorter period. The highest interest rate offered by the bank is 5.70% for the deposit amount.</li>
                    <li><b>Deposit Tenure:</b> As mentioned in the previous point, low interest rates are offered for short tenure RDs and vice-versa.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Eligibility Criteria to Open an RD Account</h2>
                <p>To open a PNB RD account, you must fulfil these eligibility requirements:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Individuals, more than 10 years of age, can open an RD account by furnishing valid age proof.</li>
                    <li>Minors below 10 years of age are allowed to operate an RD account under their parent's/guardianship.</li>
                    <li>Even the municipalities, panchayats, and other quasi-government bodies can also have access to RD in PNB.</li>
                    <li>HUF's, charitable trusts, proprietorships can also open recurring deposit accounts.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Documents Required</h2>
                <p>To open a Punjab National Bank RD account, you are required to submit any of the following documents mentioned below:</p>
                <p><b>(A) Identity proof</b></p>

                    <li>Bank account statements with a cheque</li>
                    <li>Any certificate or ID card issued by the post office</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Components of the PNB RD</h2>
                 <ul>
                    <li><b>Premature Withdrawal Rules on PNB RD</b></li>
                 </ul>
                 <p>As per the bank rules, the bank levies a penalty of 1% if the deposited amount is withdrawn before the maturity period. This penalty is also applicable on cases the deposits are irregular or discontinued.</p>

                 <ul>
                    <li><b>Tax Benefits</b></li>
                 </ul>
                 <p>PNB RDs are not eligible for tax breaks. The interest income earned from RDs is taxable according to the individual's income tax slab rate. Furthermore, if the annual interest income reaches INR 40,000, PNB deducts a 10% TDS (INR 50,000 for senior citizens). The 10% TDS rate is only applied when PAN data are given; otherwise, the bank deducts TDS at 20%.</p>

                 <ul>
                    <li><b>Loan Facility</b></li>
                 </ul>
                 <p>PNB allows investors to borrow against their recurring deposits. This will assist them in meeting their liquidity needs. Furthermore, it eliminates the need to apply for a new loan.</p>
