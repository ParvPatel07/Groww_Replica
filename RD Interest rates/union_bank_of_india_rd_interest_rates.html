                <p>The interest on Union Bank Recurring Deposit is compounded at each quarter.</p>
                <p>This formula used for calculation of the maturity value is -</p>
                 <p>A= P x [(1+R/n)^(nt)]</p>
                 <p>Here,</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A = Maturity Amount</li>
                    <li>P = Recurring Deposit installment</li>
                    <li>n = Number of times the interest is compounded.</li>
                    <li>R = Rate of interest</li>
                    <li>t is the Tenure.</li>
                </ul>
                 <p>This calculation of interest for Union Bank Recurring Deposit is illustrated in the example given below:</p>
