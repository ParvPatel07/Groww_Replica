                <h1>Income Tax Refund</h1>
                <p>An income tax refund is credited when a taxpayer pays more taxes than their actual liability. It can be issued against different types of direct taxes, like self-assessment tax, Tax Deducted at Source, foreign tax credit, advance tax, etc. The Income Tax Department processes the returns. If a taxpayer is eligible to get a refund, he or she is informed of the same via an SMS or email. Individuals receive the total amount of refund credited to their account, along with a refund receipt document.</p>
                <p>The Income Tax Department directly deposits the refund amount into the taxpayer's bank account via ECS or RTGS. The fund is credited either directly to the taxpayer's account via RTGS or NEFT or a bank cheque is dispatched via post to the registered address.</p>
                <p>Want to know more about income tax refunds, when and how to claim it, the process for checking income tax refund status, and interest on delayed refunds? Read on.</p>

                <h2>When to Claim IT Refund?</h2>
                <p>Refund is issued under several circumstances, for example, if a taxpayer has a fixed deposit and earns interest on the investment. Additionally, refund is given when the taxpayer gets a salary. The taxpayer belongs to the tax slab. He or she can claim a refund for tax on the additional deducted amount.</p>
                <p>Income tax refund can also be claimed against tax on income in the Tax Deducted at Source (TDS). Taxpayers can claim tax benefits of up to Rs. 1.5 Lakh per annum.</p>
                <p>IT refund can also be obtained against house rent allowance, medical expenses, and other deductions.</p>

                <h2>Who is Eligible for Income Tax Refund?</h2>
                <p>Here is a swift guideline for refund in a variety of circumstances. Among them are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>If the tax paid in advance under self-assessment is greater than the tax payable under the conventional assessment.</li>
                    <li>If tax on Salary, interest on securities or debentures, dividends, or other related income like tax payable on a regular basis.</li>
                    <li>If the Tax charged on a regular basis is decreased because an error in the assessment process was corrected.</li>
                    <li>If the income earned in another country is taxed there as well and in India (due to an agreement to prevent double taxation) and in India.</li>
                    <li>If you have unclaimed tax deductions under the sections 80C, 80D, etc.</li>
                    <li>If after preparing the income tax return and the deductions you've allowed, you discover that the tax paid amount is negative.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>One can also claim an income tax refund in case his or her employer deducts more than the payable <a href="#">income tax</a>.</p>

                <h2>Interest on Delayed Income Tax Refund</h2>
                <p>If the income tax refund is delayed, then the Income Tax Department stands liable to pay interest at the rate of 6% per annum.</p>
                <p>Note the calculation of the interest applicable to your refund amount will be done from the date on which the income tax was paid to the IT Department to the date on which the tax refund was made.</p>
                <p>Understanding your income tax refund status allows timely receipt of refunds for excess tax payments made. Whether through direct deposit or issuance of cheques, monitoring your refund timeline ensures transparency and efficiency. Stay informed and proactive to manage your tax refunds effectively.</p>
