                <h2>Rules of Income Tax in India</h2>
                <p>The Income Tax Act of 1961 was enacted by the legislature to govern and manage income tax in the country. Furthermore, the income tax rule can only be read in conjunction with the Income Tax Act. The Finance Act is passed every year by the Parliament of India. The Finance Act changes the Income Tax Act of 1961. Therefore, the Income Tax Rules are created within the framework of the Income Tax Act and are not permitted to supercede its scope.</p>

                <h2>Who are Tax Payers in India?</h2>
                <p>Any Indian person under the age of 60 who earns more than Rs. 2.5 lakh is required to pay income tax. Individuals above the age of 60 who earn more than Rs. 3 lakh per year must pay taxes to the Government of India.</p>
                <p>The below-mentioned entities are liable to pay taxes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Individuals (Resident and Non-Resident)</li>
                    <li>Hindu Undivided Families (HUF)</li>
                    <li>Association of Persons (AOP)</li>
                    <li>Body of Individuals (BOI)</li>
                    <li>Companies</li>
                    <li>Firms</li>
                    <li>Local Authorities</li>
                    <li>All Artificial Juridical Persons</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Unlike individuals and HUFs, taxation of the remaining categories is fixed differently.</p>
                <p>Companies are taxed based on their income slab, whilst businesses and Indian companies have a fixed value of tax computed on their taxable profits.</p>
                <p>People's earnings are classified into tax brackets or tax slabs. And the tax rate varies for each tax slab. The rate where earnings are subject to Income Tax is called Income tax rate.</p>

                <h2>Terms of Income Tax</h2>
                <p>Here are some key terms associated with income tax:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Financial Year</strong></li>
                </ul>
                <p>The financial year is a one-year term used by taxpayers for accounting and financial reporting. It is the fiscal year in which income is earned. Such a period runs from April 1 of the calendar year to March 31 of the following calendar year.</p>
                <p>This abbreviation is "FY". For example, FY 2024-25 refers to the fiscal year beginning on April 1st, 2024, and ending on March 31st, 2025.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Assessment Year</strong></li>
                </ul>
                <p>The assessment year is the one-year period from April 1 to March 31, beginning immediately after the fiscal year. This period is known as the assessment year because all taxpayers must evaluate their income received throughout the fiscal year to determine their tax obligations.</p>
                <p>For example, the assessment year for income received during FY 2024-25 will be AY 2025-26.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>PAN</strong></li>
                </ul>

                <p>When paying advance tax or self-assessment tax, the individual must include all of his PAN number. Also, when the individual presents his PAN to certain businesses like banks, mutual fund, and so on.</p>
                <p>The Income Tax Department maintains a database of all taxpayers in India using PAN. This enables the tax collector to associate all tax-related transactions with the department. As a result, it proves to be easy to identify all of your financial transactions simply by entering a person's account number.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>ASSESSEE</strong></li>
                </ul>
                <p>An assessee is a person or group who determines his or her income and pays tax in accordance with the Income Tax Act.</p>
                <p>This assessee could be an individual, a partnership, a corporation, an Association of Persons (AOP), a trust, or any other entity.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Indian Residents and NRIs</strong></li>
                </ul>
                <p>In India, income tax is levied based on a taxpayer's residency status. Individuals who qualify as Indian residents must pay tax on their worldwide income in India, which includes money generated both in India and abroad.</p>
                <p>Non-residents, on the other hand, must pay tax only on their Indian income for each fiscal year in which income was generated. The residency status of an individual is assessed and consequently</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>TAN</strong></li>
                </ul>
                <p>It is a one-of-a-kind ten-digit alphanumeric digit assigned by the Income Tax Department of India. All persons in charge of a tax deduction (TDS) or collection (TCS) are responsible for getting TAN.

                <h2>How to Calculate Income Tax?</h2>
                <p>Individuals should calculate income tax based on the nature of their earnings. Salary earners might make use of the income tax calculator on the income tax website.</p>
                <p>Individuals and HUFs can take a deduction under Section 80C through 80U, subject to their total gross income, and then compute their income tax due. In addition, the total income tax liability should be adjusted for taxes paid, TDS, and TCS by the individual or HUF. However, no adjustments are allowed under Sections 80C through Section 80U and relief under Sections 89, 90, and 91 to determine the net amount of income tax payable.</p>
                <p>Every source of income should be reported on your tax return. Of course, the legislation exempts some incomes, such as agricultural income or a gift from a relative. If you are the head of your family, be sure to list any family income and so on.</p>
                <p>As a result, follow this swift guideline you can possibly use to calculate taxes payable on your income:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>List all of your earnings, whether they be salary, rental income, interest income, capital gains, or profits from your business or profession.</li>
                    <li>Income that is legally exempt should be omitted.</li>
                    <li>Claim all appropriate deductions for each source of income. For example, claim a standard deduction of Rs. 50,000 from salary income, municipal taxes from rental revenue, business-related costs from business turnovers, and so on.</li>
                    <li>Claim all eligible exemptions under each category of income. For example, the money accumulated in another house property can be claimed as an exemption from capital gains income, and so on.</li>
                    <li>Claim any appropriate deductions from your total income, such as the 80C, 80D, 80TTA, 80TTB, and so forth.</li>
                    <li>You have now calculated your taxable income. Check your tax bracket and calculate your income tax liability accordingly.</li>
