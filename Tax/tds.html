                <h2>What is Tax Deducted at Source (TDS)?</h2>
                <p>Tax Deducted at Source is a type of advance tax that the Government of India levies on a periodic basis. This overall deducted tax is claimed as a tax refund after a taxpayer files the Income Tax Return.</p>

                <p>TDS deduction is applicable to both of the following income sources -</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Salary</li>
                    <li>Commission earned</li>
                    <li>Rent</li>
                    <li>Interest payment by banks</li>
                    <li>Professional or consultant fees</li>
                    <li>Contract payments</li>
                    <li>Amount under LIC</li>
                    <li>Compensation on acquiring immovable property</li>
                    <li>Dividend on mutual funds</li>
                    <li>Insurance Commission</li>
                    <li>Interest on securities</li>
                    <li>Payment made to the director of a company, etc.</li>
                    <li>Winning from games like a crossword puzzle, card, lottery, etc.</li>
                    <li>Interest on infrastructure or securities</li>
                    <li>Dividend Dividend</li>
                    <li>Transfer of immovable property</li>
                </ul>

                <p>TDS deduction is done by the person (payer) from whom a payment is being paid. Any delay in the deduction will be subjected to a penalty of 1% interest per month until the tax is deducted. </p>

                <h2>How to Calculate TDS?</h2>
                <p>Let's look at a few examples to understand the TDS calculating better with its Application:</p>
                <p>Example 1:</p>
                <p>Assume Mr. Paul is a self-employed professional who got paid Rs.40,000 as advance and received another Rs.20,000 after completion of his work.</p>
                <p>In this scenario, the payer will deduct TDS from the advance (Rs.4,000, 10% of Rs.40,000) and the rest (Rs.2,000, 10% of Rs.20,000). The total payable taxable amount will be Rs.6,000.</p>
                <p>Example 2:</p>
                <p>Mr. Paul receives the complete payment after the completion of his work. In this case, he will be taxed @2% (Rs.1,200) for the total sum of Rs.60,000, and Rs.58,800 will be paid to him for his work.</p>

                <h2>How TDS Works and Who Can Deduct It?</h2>
                <p>The person making the payment is liable for a TDS deduction. That individual or organisation is liable to deduct TDS from the taxpayer and deposit it to the IT Department on behalf of the taxpayer. It is a certain percentage of one's monthly income which is deducted before the salary is paid.</p>
                <p>Currently, TDS is applicable on certain payments at a rate of 10%, while on others, a rate of 20% applies (like MMR is maintained).</p>

                <h2>TDS Return and the Associated Forms</h2>
                <p>TDS return is a statement issued after a quarterly payment of the taxes, containing all the transactions mentioned wherein TDS deduction made during a quarter. It is issued by the payer and submitted to the Income Tax Department annually.</p>

                <p>Tax returns contain all TDS deduction details collected by the payer, as well as other essential information like the PAN number of the taxpayer, the amount of payment made, and the particulars regarding the payment made to the Government of India. It also collects TDS challan information.</p>

                <p>There are several forms associated with TDS returns, the following table contains its relevant details:</p>

                <h2>Penalty Provision</h2>
                <p>If you fail to comply with the TDS deduction rules, you will be liable to pay penalties, usually in the form of fines and interest levied on the principal taxable amount.</p>
                <p>There are multiple types of penalties levied, for example -</p>

                <h3>Regulation Regarding Tax Deduction</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>In case the person responsible for TDS deduction fails to do so, they are likely to be restricted from ascertaining the details of the tax deduction.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Regulations Regarding TDS Payment</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Taxpayers are required to pay the taxable sum to the Government of India by the 7th day of the month, which succeeds the preceding month.</li>
                    <li>Incidents of more or less TDS payment will attract a penalty of 0.5% per month (on the total payable sum) till the sum is deposited.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Regulations Regarding TDS Return Filing</h3>
                <p>TDS returns should be filed on the 31st of January, 31st of May, 31st of July, and 31st of October every financial year.</p>
                <p>Any delay in the filing of a TDS return will attract a penalty of Rs 200 per day (according to Section 234E of the Income Tax Act of India) till the return is filed. However, the penalty should not exceed the total sum of tax levied.</p>

                <h2>How to Know the Deducted TDS Amount</h2>
                <p>The process to find whether TDS has been deducted or not and whether it has been remitted to a particular account can be done through the following steps:</p>
                <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Navigate to the official website of the Income Tax Department of India and select the option to register as a new user.</p>
                <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Enter details of the Permanent Account Number and generate a password.</p>
                <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> After logging in with the registered ID and password, select the option to view the tax credit statement or Form 26AS.</p>
                <p><strong>Form 26AS</strong> is a tax credit statement that carries all the TDS details deducted during a financial year.</p>
                <p><strong>Step 4:</strong> The website will redirect to the page for the TDS Reconciliation Analysis and Correction Enabling System, which will show all the details of a taxpayer's tax liabilities, including details of Tax Deducted at Source, advance tax paid, and self-assessment tax paid.</p>

                <h2>TDS Refund and Non-reduction of the Applicable Tax</h2>
                <p>If a taxpayer pays more tax than what he or she is legally obligated to pay, they will be able to claim a tax refund from the Income Tax Department. This is applicable when the tax paid by the taxpayer is more than the tax liability for the financial year. The excess tax paid can be claimed as a tax refund by filing the income tax return.</p>
                <p>To claim a tax refund, the taxpayer has to file the income tax return within the due date. The income tax return form has a section to claim the tax refund. The taxpayer has to provide details of the tax paid, including the TDS details, advance tax paid, and self-assessment tax paid.</p>
                <p>If an individual's annual income does not fall under the taxable threshold, they can request for zero deduction of tax on their income as well. This can be completed via different methods -</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Submitting a declaration under Section 197A in Form 15G or 15H to the payer. These forms are applicable for individuals and HUFs who are not liable to pay tax on their income.</li>
                    <li>Submitting a certificate for deduction of tax at a lower or nil rate from the Assessing Officer.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Tax Deducted at Source is deducted under Income Tax Act 1961. Every taxpayer should be thoroughly aware of the taxation laws, forms, etc., in order to adhere to the regulations of the Income Tax Department of India.</p>
