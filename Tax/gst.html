                <h1>What is GST? (Goods and Services Tax)</h1>

                <p>The full form of GST is Goods and Services Tax. It was first introduced in the Budget Speech presented on 28th February, 2006. It had the foundation for a comprehensive reform of India's indirect tax system. It was implemented on 1st July, 2017, as the Goods and Services Tax Act. It replaced several taxes levied by the Central and State Governments, simplifying the taxation structure. This landmark reform aimed at creating a unified national market and boosting economic growth. GST is a destination-based tax levied at all stages from manufacture to consumption, with credit of taxes paid at previous stages available as set-off. This not only avoids the cascading effect of taxes but also ensures that the final consumer bears only the GST charged by the last supplier in the supply chain. The GST regime is managed by the Goods and Services Tax Council, which is the governing body responsible for making recommendations on all matters related to GST, including tax rates, rules, and regulations. The implementation of GST has streamlined the tax collection process, reduced compliance burden for businesses, and improved transparency in the taxation system. It has also led to increased tax buoyancy and formalization of the economy. Despite initial challenges, GST has emerged as a transformative tax reform that has positively impacted the Indian economy. It is still evolving with continuous changes and updates being made to the laws and procedures to further simplify and improve the system.</p>

                <h2>GST Meaning and Scope</h2>
                <p>Goods and Services Tax (GST) is a destination-based multi-stage, comprehensive tax levied at each stage of value addition. Having replaced multiple indirect taxes in the country, it has successfully helped the Indian economy by creating a unified national market.</p>

                <p>GST is levied on goods and services sold within India's domestic boundary for consumption, implemented by a majority of nations worldwide with respective customizations. The tax has been successful in simplifying the indirect tax structure and increasing tax compliance. GST is a consumption-based tax, which means that the tax is levied at the point of consumption rather than at the point of production. This ensures that the tax is collected by the state where the goods or services are finally consumed, thus promoting fair distribution of tax revenue among states. The GST framework is designed to be transparent and efficient, with online portals and digital systems for registration, filing of returns, and payment of taxes. This has not only reduced the compliance burden for businesses but also improved the ease of doing business in India. The GST Council, which is the governing body for GST, regularly meets to discuss and resolve issues related to GST implementation, ensuring that the tax system is responsive to the needs of businesses and taxpayers. Overall, GST has been a transformative reform that has streamlined the indirect tax system, boosted economic growth, and improved tax compliance in India. It is a dynamic tax system that is continuously evolving to adapt to the changing economic landscape.</p>

                <p>GST is levied on the final market price of goods and services manufactured internally, thereby reflecting the maximum retail price. Customers are required to pay this tax on a purchase of goods or services as an inclusion on their bill which is collected by the seller and then remitted to the government. This process ensures that the tax is collected at every stage of the supply chain, from production to consumption, and that the final consumer bears the ultimate tax burden. The GST framework also includes provisions for input tax credit, which allows businesses to claim credit for the GST paid on their inputs, thus avoiding the cascading effect of taxes and reducing the overall tax burden on businesses.

                <p>Currently, GST is levied on different goods and services are uniformly applied across the country. Goods and services have, however, been divided into different categories for the purpose of taxation under GST. These categories are based on the nature of the goods and services, their essentiality, and their impact on the economy. Some goods and services are exempted from GST, while others are taxed at different rates, ranging from 0% to 28%. This differential taxation is aimed at ensuring that essential goods and services are affordable for the common man, while luxury goods and services are taxed at higher rates. The GST framework also includes provisions for input tax credit, which allows businesses to claim credit for the GST paid on their inputs, thus avoiding the cascading effect of taxes and reducing the overall tax burden on businesses.

                <h2>List of Taxes Subsumed under GST Implementation</h2>
                <p>GST aimed to replace a plethora of existing indirect tax structures. With the introduction, the government intended to consolidate all indirect taxes under one roof, GST.</p>
                <p>Thus, except for customs duty that is levied on the import of goods, Goods and Services Tax replaced multiple indirect taxes. This consolidation has streamlined the indirect tax system and reduced the compliance burden for businesses. It has also led to increased transparency and efficiency in the taxation system.</p>
                <p>Following is the list of indirect taxes that were subsumed by Goods and Service Tax -</p>

                <h3>Indirect Taxes Imposed by the Central Government</h3>
                <ul>

                </ul>

                <h2>Objectives of GST</h2>
                <p>The key objectives of GST are -</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>One Nation, One Tax</strong></li>
                </ul>
                <p>GST has the place of many indirect taxes that existed before. It was introduced with a core motive and policy called 'One Nation, One Tax'. The move has streamlined the taxation system across India, ensuring that every state would have its own simplified and streamlined tax laws and procedures. This has not only reduced the compliance burden for businesses but also improved the ease of doing business in India. The GST framework is designed to be transparent and efficient, with online portals and digital systems for registration, filing of returns, and payment of taxes. This has further enhanced transparency and efficiency in the taxation system. The GST Council, which is the governing body for GST, regularly meets to discuss and resolve issues related to GST implementation, ensuring that the tax system is responsive to the needs of businesses and taxpayers. Overall, GST has been a transformative reform that has streamlined the indirect tax system, boosted economic growth, and improved tax compliance in India. It is a dynamic tax system that is continuously evolving to adapt to the changing economic landscape.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>To Subsume Indirect Taxes in India</strong></li>
                </ul>
                <p>GST has replaced a plethora of taxes on goods and services. GST was introduced in India. Under its laws, the majority of indirect taxes were subsumed into one simplified administration.</p>
                 <ul>
                    <li><strong>To Restrain Tax Evasion</strong></li>
                </ul>
                <p>Prior to the introduction of GST, the tax evasion rate was very high. In order to curb evasion and create a centralised tax system, GST was introduced in India. It has successfully helped in curbing the instances of tax defaults.</p>

                <h2>Types of GST and GST Rules</h2>
                <p>GST is applicable only if there is a supply of goods and services. Before a business can determine its GST liability, assessing the following table about the Components of GST is essential:</p>

                <p>Here's an example to help you understand the levy, collection, and share of revenue between the state and the central government.</p>
                <p>A seller in Maharashtra sells goods worth Rs. 1 Lakh to a buyer in the same state. The tax rate applicable to the goods is 18%, which includes 9% CGST and 9% SGST. The seller will collect Rs. 18,000 as GST, out of which Rs. 9,000 will be deposited with the Central Government and Rs. 9,000 with the Maharashtra Government. This ensures that the tax revenue is shared between the central and state governments based on the point of consumption. The GST system is designed to be transparent and efficient, with online portals and digital systems for registration, filing of returns, and payment of taxes. This has not only reduced the compliance burden for businesses but also improved the ease of doing business in India. The GST Council, which is the governing body for GST, regularly meets to discuss and resolve issues related to GST implementation, ensuring that the tax system is responsive to the needs of businesses and taxpayers. Overall, GST has been a transformative reform that has streamlined the indirect tax system, boosted economic growth, and improved tax compliance in India. It is a dynamic tax system that is continuously evolving to adapt to the changing economic landscape.</p>
                <p>Now consider a seller in Maharashtra selling goods worth Rs. 1 Lakh to a buyer in Karnataka. The tax rate applicable to the goods is 18% IGST. The seller will thus charge GST of Rs. 18,000 from the buyer due to it being an inter-state sale. This tax will be deposited with the Central Government.</p>
                <p>Once collected, the tax will be shared by the central government and state government based on the supply of goods made. For ease of tax collection, the government has made the entire system for the payment of GST online.</p>

                <h2>Understanding the Dual Structure of Goods and Services Tax</h2>
                <p>Since Goods and Services Tax is a destination-based tax, it is levied by both the Central and State Governments. This dual structure allows both the Centre and the State to levy and collect taxes.</p>
                <p>Goods and Services Tax in India carries this same dual structure, thus having two components, state as well as a central component. This means that every transaction under GST will involve both a central and a state component, except for inter-state transactions which will involve an integrated GST. The dual structure ensures that both the central and state governments have a share in the tax revenue, thus promoting fiscal federalism. The GST framework also includes provisions for input tax credit, which allows businesses to claim credit for the GST paid on their inputs, thus avoiding the cascading effect of taxes and reducing the overall tax burden on businesses. The GST system is designed to be transparent and efficient, with online portals and digital systems for registration, filing of returns, and payment of taxes. This has not only reduced the compliance burden for businesses but also improved the ease of doing business in India. The GST Council, which is the governing body for GST, regularly meets to discuss and resolve issues related to GST implementation, ensuring that the tax system is responsive to the needs of businesses and taxpayers. Overall, GST has been a transformative reform that has streamlined the indirect tax system, boosted economic growth, and improved tax compliance in India. It is a dynamic tax system that is continuously evolving to adapt to the changing economic landscape.</p>

                <h2>Concepts of GST Levy - Multi-Stage, Destination-based and Value Added</h2>
                <p>This comprehensive nature of the Goods and Services Tax levy takes into account every stage of manufacture and distribution, right from the purchase of raw materials to the final sale to the consumer.</p>

                <p>The various stages of GST application are discussed below:</p>

                <h3>Meaning of Multi-Stage Levy</h3>
                <p>From production/manufacture to consumption, tax is levied at each stage of the supply chain, from the purchase of raw materials to the final sale to the consumer.</p>

                <p>The different stages of production of a finished good and its corresponding rate in the market comprise the following stages:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Raw material purchase</li>
                    <li>Manufacture/production of raw materials into finished goods</li>
                    <li>Storage in warehouse/godown</li>
                    <li>Sale of goods to the wholesaler</li>
                    <li>Sale of goods to the retailer</li>
                    <li>Final sale to the consumer</li>
                </ul>
                <p>GST charged at each link of this chain makes it a multi-stage tax.</p>

                <h3>Meaning of Destination-based Levy</h3>
                <p>A destination-based levy means the tax is to be taxed at the place where it is consumed and not at its origin. This means that the location where an item is consumed will rightfully collect the tax.</p>

                <p>In this context, it is essential to differentiate the concept of 'supply' from 'place of supply'. The decision regarding whether a sale is interstate or intrastate will be based accordingly.</p>

                 <h3>Meaning of Taxation on Value Addition</h3>
                <p>This concept of GST on value addition implies every addition made to an item to make it saleable to the end user is taxable under this regime. Understand it with the help of an example:</p>

                <p>The manufacturing unit of Britannia Industries Limited in Chennai, Tamil Nadu, manufactures a variety of biscuits. During the manufacturing process, it goes through the following stages, with value added at each stage:</p>
                <ul>

                <h2>Composition Scheme under GST</h2>
                <p>The composition scheme under GST eases the process of indirect tax payment for small taxpayers. As per the CBIC, companies with an annual turnover within Rs. 1 Crore can opt for the scheme to pay their taxes. For North Eastern states, the threshold limit is Rs. 75 Lakh. Businesses under this scheme benefit from simplified tax compliance and lower tax rates. However, they cannot claim input tax credit and are restricted from making inter-state sales. The composition scheme is an optional scheme for small taxpayers to reduce their compliance burden and simplify the taxation process. They are required to file simplified quarterly returns and pay taxes at a fixed percentage of their turnover. This scheme is available for manufacturers, traders, and restaurants with a certain annual turnover. The government has also introduced a higher threshold limit for certain states to promote ease of doing business. Overall, the composition scheme is a beneficial option for small taxpayers to reduce their tax burden and simplify their tax compliance under the GST regime.</p>

                <p>The tax rate applicable under the composition scheme includes the following:</p>

                <table>
                    <thead>
                        <tr>
                            <th>Business type</th>
                            <th>Rate of CGST</th>
                            <th>Rate of SGST</th>
                            <th>Total GST Rate</th>
                        </tr>
                    </thead>
                    <tbody>
                        <tr>
                            <td>Goods Traders and Manufacturers</td>
                            <td>0.5%</td>
                            <td>0.5%</td>
                            <td>1%</td>
                        </tr>
                         <tr>
                            <td>Restaurants that do not serve alcohol</td>
                            <td>2.5%</td>
                            <td>2.5%</td>
                            <td>5%</td>
                        </tr>
                    </tbody>
                </table>

                <p>You must, however, also meet a set of conditions to avail of the scheme. A taxpayer needs to file GST CMP-02 when opting for the scheme. This is a mandatory step to inform the tax authorities about their decision to opt for the composition scheme. The taxpayer is also required to issue a bill of supply instead of a tax invoice and mention 'Composition Taxable Person, not eligible to collect tax on supplies' on the bill. They also need to file quarterly returns in Form GSTR-4 and an annual return in Form GSTR-9A. It is important for taxpayers to carefully consider the pros and cons of the composition scheme before opting for it, as it may not be suitable for all businesses. They should also ensure that they meet all the eligibility criteria and comply with the rules and regulations of the scheme to avoid any penalties or legal issues. The government has also introduced various initiatives to promote the composition scheme and encourage small taxpayers to opt for it, such as providing online tools and resources for easy compliance. Overall, the composition scheme is a beneficial option for small taxpayers to simplify their tax compliance and reduce their tax burden under the GST regime.</p>

                <h2>Concept of Input Tax Credit (ITC) under GST in India</h2>
                <p>An Input Tax Credit (ITC) means that when a business person or a trader is paying tax on output, he/she can reduce the tax already paid on input (purchases).</p>

                <p>For example, in the case of a manufacturer selling the final product, the output tax stands at Rs. 450. However, he already paid Rs. 300 as input tax while purchasing the product. He can thus receive an ITC of Rs. 300 on the final product and needs to pay only the difference of Rs. 150, i.e., Rs. 450 - Rs. 300 to the government as Goods and Services Tax.</p>

                <p>ITC can be claimed only by businesses registered under the Goods and Services Tax Act. Also, all registered suppliers must be registered under the act for you to be eligible to avail of ITC.</p>

                <p>Hence, go for Goods & Service Tax registration if you are eligible and not yet registered. Also, file Goods and Services Tax returns and pay your taxes within the due date to avoid any inconvenience.</p>
