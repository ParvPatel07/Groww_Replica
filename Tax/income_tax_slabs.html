                <h1>Income Tax Slabs FY 2025-26 | AY 2026-27</h1>
                <p>Income tax is levied on the total income of an individual or entity. The tax liability is determined based on income tax slabs, which are different income brackets with corresponding tax rates. The tax slabs and rates are announced in the Union Budget each year. This page provides information on the income tax slabs for FY 2025-26 (AY 2026-27) under both the Old and New Regimes, along with recent updates and details on taxable income sources.</p>

                <h2>Income Tax Changes Introduced in Budget 2025</h2>
                <p><strong>No Tax Liability up to Rs 12 lakh:</strong></p>
                <p>The most significant change is the proposed income tax rates so that taxpayers with income of up to Rs 12 lakh will have zero liability. The new rates do not include any other income such as capital gains. This reduction in negative income tax rates is expected to boost economic growth.</p>

                 <p><strong>Hike in Section 57A Rebate:</strong></p>
                 <p>In the Union Budget 2025, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced a hike in the tax rebate under Section 57A for individuals opting for the new tax regime. The rebate limit has been increased from Rs. 25,000 to Rs. 50,000. This means that taxpayers with income up to Rs. 12 lakh can now claim a higher rebate, effectively reducing their tax liability to zero. This move is aimed at providing relief to the middle-class taxpayers and encouraging them to opt for the new tax regime.</p>

                <h2>TDS Threshold Increased</h2>
                <p>The budget proposed increasing the threshold for tax deducted at source (TDS) on rent from Rs 2.4 lakh to Rs 3 lakh per annum. This means that individuals and Hindu Undivided Families (HUFs) paying rent up to Rs 3 lakh per annum will not be required to deduct TDS. Additionally, the budget has proposed increasing the limit on tax deduction on interest for senior citizens from Rs 10,000 to Rs 50,000.</p>

                 <h2>TCS on Remittances Limit Increased</h2>
                <p>The limit on the tax collected at source (TCS) on remittances under the Reserve Bank of India (RBI)’s Liberalised Remittance Scheme (LRS) has been increased from Rs 7 lakh to Rs 10 lakh. Any amount remitted above this limit would be subject to TCS. This change provides relief to individuals remitting smaller amounts abroad. However, remittances above Rs 10 lakh will still attract TCS as per the existing rates.</p>

                <h2>Tax Savings under New Tax Regime</h2>
                <p>This section provides a comparison table to help taxpayers understand how much tax they can save by opting for the new tax regime compared to the old regime.</p>

                <h2>Tax on Firms</h2>
                <p>Although the Union Budget 2025 did not bring about any changes in the taxation on firms, there are several key updates that provide a boost to companies.</p>

                <h2>Relief for Startups</h2>
                <p>The union budget announced a three-year tax holiday for eligible startups within the first 10 years of their operation.</p>

                <h2>Carry Forward Losses in Mergers</h2>
                <p>A new company can carry forward losses for the remaining years instead of starting fresh after a merger.</p>

                <h2>Simplifying TDS and TCS</h2>
                <p>The union budget simplified the TDS and TCS calculation on the sale of goods by only charging 0.1% TDS on the sale of goods that exceed Rs 50 lakh. This change removes the confusion of double taxation. In addition, businesses won’t be penalised for delays in depositing TCS.</p>

                <h2>Updating Tax Returns</h2>
                <p>The time limit to update and correct tax filings has been extended from two years to four. Extra tax or 60% will be charged in the third year and 70% in the fourth year.</p>

                <h2>Transfer Pricing</h2>
                <p>In the case of related party transactions, a business can use the same transfer pricing for three years to reduce tax disputes.</p>

                <h2>Taxable Income Sources in India</h2>
                <p>As a taxpayer, it is important to know the various sources of income that can be taxed.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Salary Income</strong></li>
                </ul>
                <p>The income an individual earns as a salary is subject to taxation based on the tax slab and the age of the individual. The pension of an individual after retirement is also subject to taxation based on the tax slab.</p>
                 <ul>
                    <li><strong>Business Income</strong></li>
                </ul>
                <p>Business income refers to the profits of a business or profession. The income is taxed only after adjusting the income for the permitted deductions.</p>
                 <ul>
                    <li><strong>Property Income</strong></li>
                </ul>
                <p>The income earned through owning and renting out houses is a source of property income. This income is taxable at the respective tax slab rate.</p>
                 <ul>
                    <li><strong>Capital Gains</strong></li>
                </ul>
                <p>The profits earned after the sale of an asset such as stocks, gold, or real estate attract capital gains tax. The capital gains tax is levied depending on the duration of the investment.</p>
                 <ul>
                    <li><strong>Other Income</strong></li>
                </ul>
                <p>Income earned from activities like horse races or lotteries is taxable. However, this income is taxed separately and is not part of the tax slab of the fiscal year.</p>
