                <h2>What is 80C Deduction?</h2>
                <p>Section 80C permits certain investments and expenses to be tax-exempted.</p>

                <p>By implementing the 80C deduction, you can make your income tax payment easier, and reduce your tax liability considerably. The maximum deduction you can claim under this section is Rs 1,50,000. By investing in instruments eligible under 80C, individuals can save a significant amount on their taxes. This not only helps in reducing the tax burden but also encourages individuals to save and invest for their future. Therefore, it is essential for every taxpayer to be aware of the various investment options available under Section 80C and make the most of them to minimize their tax liability.</p>

                <p>Under the Income Tax Act of India, deductions under Section 80C of Income Tax Act are divided into certain sub-sections. These are:</p>
