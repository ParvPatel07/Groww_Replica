This is primarily important if there is an amount of refund to be claimed.</p>

A total of Rs.100 (Rs.50 as CGST and Rs.50 as SGST) is charged per day, which can go as high as Rs.5000. However, this penalty is only applicable if the tax liability is higher than Rs. 1 Lakh. This is only applicable for businesses with a turnover of more than Rs. 1.5 Crore. For businesses with a turnover less than Rs. 1.5 Crore, the penalty is Rs. 50 per day (Rs. 25 as CGST and Rs. 25 as SGST).</p>
                <p>The late fee for the annual return (GSTR-9) is Rs. 100 per day (Rs. 50 as CGST and Rs. 50 as SGST) for each Act, subject to a maximum of 0.25% of the turnover in the State or Union Territory.</p>

                <p>Integrated Goods and Services Tax does not attract any late fee, although the taxpayer will be required to pay an interest of 18% per annum on the due tax sum.</p>
                <p>Every taxpayer should be well aware of the process of GST filing. It will help them abide by the latest regulations of Goods and Services Tax at all times.</p>
