                <h1>GST Registration - Types of GST Registration, Documents and Fees</h1>

                <p>On July 1, 2017, the Indian Government introduced a new tax regime, Goods and Service Tax (GST) Act, 2017. The act was officially passed on March 29 the same year in the Parliament.</p>

                <p>GST is an indirect tax that was formed to abolish several other indirect taxes in India, to create a single taxation regime for ease of collection and to increase the efficiency of the process.</p>

                <p>Today, new GST registration has become mandatory for businesses with an annual turnover of Rs. 40 Lakh and above (Rs. 10 Lakh for North Eastern states) for goods and services respectively. All other businesses can opt for voluntary registration under GST.</p>

                <p>The GSTN registration process is relatively simple and will hardly take between 2 and 6 working days to complete.</p>

                <p>But first, here are the various kinds of GST applicable in India.</p>

                <h2>Types of GST</h2>
                <p>GST can be divided into four sections, based on the kind of transaction it involves. Before a business can determine its GST liability, assessing the following table is essential:</p>

                <table>
                    <thead>
                        <tr>
                            <th>GST Types</th>
                            <th>What it is</th>
                        </tr>
                    </thead>
                    <tbody>
                        <tr>
                            <td>State Goods and Services Tax (SGST)</td>
                            <td>SGST refers to the tax payable on the sale of services and products within a state. It replaces previous taxes, including Value Added Tax, Entry Tax, State Sales Tax, Entertainment Tax, Luxury Tax, and Lottery Tax.</td>
                        </tr>
                         <tr>
                            <td>Central Goods and Services Tax (CGST)</td>
                            <td>The tax levied on the supply of intra-state products is CGST. The Central Government regulates this tax. CGST replaced many taxes levied by the Centre, including Service Tax, Central Excise Duty, and Additional Customs Duty.</td>
                        </tr>
                         <tr>
                            <td>Union Territory Goods and Services Tax (UTGST)</td>
                            <td>This applies to the sale of products and services in Union Territories, such as Andaman and Nicobar, Daman and Diu, Chandigarh, Dadra, etc.</td>
                        </tr>
                         <tr>
                            <td>Integrated Goods and Services Tax (IGST)</td>
                            <td>Sale of inter-state products and services leads to IGST. This is IGST which is collected by the Central Government, and is then shared equally between the states.</td>
                        </tr>
                    </tbody>
                </table>

                <h2>Who Should Register for GST?</h2>
                <p>Businesses and other entities carrying out taxable supplies in India are required to register for GST if their aggregate annual turnover exceeds the threshold limit. The threshold limit for GST registration varies based on the nature of the business and the state in which it operates. For businesses primarily engaged in the supply of goods, the threshold limit is Rs. 40 Lakh in most states, while for businesses providing services, the threshold limit is Rs. 20 Lakh. However, there are certain categories of businesses that are mandatorily required to register for GST irrespective of their turnover. These include businesses making inter-state taxable supplies, e-commerce operators, casual taxable persons, and non-resident taxable persons. Voluntary registration under GST is also an option for businesses that do not meet the mandatory registration criteria but wish to avail the benefits of GST, such as claiming input tax credit. The GST registration process is online and can be completed through the official GST portal. Businesses need to provide various documents and information, such as PAN, Aadhaar, business registration documents, bank account details, and proof of address, to complete the registration process. Once registered, businesses are assigned a unique GST Identification Number (GSTIN), which is a 15-digit number used for all GST-related transactions and compliances. Overall, GST registration is a crucial step for businesses to comply with the GST regime and avail its benefits. It is essential for businesses to understand the eligibility criteria, the registration process, and the documents required to ensure smooth and hassle-free registration.</p>

                <p>Business operators satisfying any of the below-mentioned clauses are liable to register for GST as per the Goods and Services Act -</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Individuals and businesses who were registered under pre-GST laws must register under GST as well.</li>
                    <li>Businesses that exceed a yearly turnover of Rs. 40 Lakh (Rs. 10 Lakh for businesses in the North-Eastern or hilly states) for goods and services respectively.</li>
                    <li>Any individual supplying products through an e-commerce aggregator</li>
                    <li>E-commerce aggregators are liable to pay GST as well.</li>
                    <li>Non-resident taxable persons</li>
                    <li>Businesses making inter-state taxable supplies are also required to register for GST.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Certain other cases of reverse charge mechanism are also eligible for new GST registration. In such cases, the receiver is liable to pay taxes, instead of the supplier of goods and services.</p>

                <p>All eligible individuals or businesses should keep several clauses regarding the eligibility and documentation to ensure a hassle-free registration process.</p>

                <h2>Types of GST Registration</h2>
                <p>Registration under GST is done under several types. Undergoing the registration procedure is essential without which businesses cannot operate. Take a look at the table below to get a better idea regarding the rules:</p>

                            <td>Individuals setting up occasional or seasonal businesses need to register their GST under this category.

                            <td>Composition registration process reduces the hassle involved with GST registration greatly. In this case, businesses need to deposit a fixed yearly payment irrespective of their actual turnover. Only companies that have a yearly turnover of up to Rs. 1.5 Crore are eligible for such a registration process.</td>

                <p>Upon furnishing all the mentioned documents, a 15-digit GSTIN is assigned uniquely to every registered business entity. This is the entity's tax charges are regulated by the department. This number is used for all GST-related transactions and compliances. It is essential for businesses to prominently display their GSTIN on their invoices, signboards, and other business documents. The GSTIN helps in tracking the tax payments and compliance status of businesses. It also facilitates the seamless flow of input tax credit across the supply chain. Businesses can verify the authenticity of a GSTIN through the official GST portal. The GSTIN is a key element of the GST regime and plays a crucial role in ensuring transparency and accountability in the taxation system. Overall, obtaining a GSTIN is a mandatory requirement for eligible businesses to operate legally and comply with the GST laws.</p>

                <h2>Fines for Not Registering under GST</h2>
                <p>In case a GST-eligible individual or business does not pay taxes, either fully or partially, he/she has to pay penalty charges for it.</p>

                <p>If the amount of payment is intentional, an unregistered individual or business in question has to pay up 80% of the total tax levied. This is only applicable if the total tax burden is higher than Rs. 1 Lakh.</p>

                <p>If the error (of payment) is unintentional, the culpable entity needs to pay the entire due amount as penalty.</p>

                <h2>What are the Advantages of GST Registration?</h2>
                <p>Business entities can enjoy several benefits under GST. These include -</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Abolition of cascading effect -</strong> The introduction of GST has eliminated the previously taxed cascading effect in India on tourism, reducing double taxation at every step. This measure has lowered the tax liability of businesses. This has made goods and services more affordable for consumers and has boosted economic growth. The GST framework also allows businesses to claim input tax credit for the GST paid on their inputs, thus avoiding the cascading effect of taxes and reducing the overall tax burden on businesses. This has improved the competitiveness of businesses and has encouraged them to comply with the GST regime. Overall, the abolition of the cascading effect has been a significant benefit of GST, leading to a more efficient and transparent indirect tax system.</li>
                    <li><strong>Convenient application procedure -</strong> The application procedure for GST registration online as well as filing of GST returns has become easier due to the online portal and digital systems. This has significantly reduced the compliance burden for businesses and has improved the ease of doing business in India. The GST portal provides a user-friendly interface for registration, filing of returns, and payment of taxes. Businesses can access various services and information related to GST through the portal. The online system has also improved transparency and efficiency in the taxation system. Overall, the convenient application procedure has been a major advantage of GST, making tax compliance easier and more accessible for businesses.</li>
                    <li><strong>Lesser compliance -</strong> Under the previous tax regime, businesses had to file multiple returns, one for each indirect tax. With GST, however, businesses need to file only one return every month, depending on their turnover and type of registration. This has significantly reduced the compliance burden for businesses and has saved them time and resources. The GST framework also includes simplified procedures for small taxpayers under the composition scheme, further reducing their compliance burden. Overall, the lesser compliance burden has been a significant benefit of GST, making tax compliance easier and more manageable for businesses.</li>
                    <li><strong>Simplified procedure for small businesses -</strong> SMEs with annual turnover less than Rs. 1.5 Crore can enjoy lower tax rates and less stringent terms of compliance if registered under the GST Composition Scheme. This scheme is designed to simplify the tax compliance for small taxpayers and reduce their tax burden. Businesses opting for the composition scheme are required to file simplified quarterly returns and pay taxes at a fixed percentage of their turnover. However, they cannot claim input tax credit and are restricted from making inter-state sales. The composition scheme is an optional scheme for small taxpayers to reduce their compliance burden and simplify the taxation process. Overall, the simplified procedure for small businesses under the composition scheme has been a major advantage of GST, promoting ease of doing business for small taxpayers.</li>
                    <li><strong>Less stringent terms on logistics -</strong> Under GST, the terms for logistics are comparatively less strict than under the previous tax regime. This has streamlined the movement of goods across states and has reduced the transportation costs for businesses. The GST framework has also eliminated the need for state-wise registration and compliance, making it easier for businesses to operate across multiple states. The implementation of e-way bills has further simplified the movement of goods and has reduced the instances of tax evasion. Overall, the less stringent terms on logistics have been a significant benefit of GST, leading to a more efficient and streamlined supply chain.</li>
                    <li><strong>Regulation of unorganised sector -</strong> Registration under GST provides comprehensive and transparent compliance, payment of taxes, and benefit of input tax credit, ensuring transparency in the tax collection system. This has brought a large number of unorganised businesses under the tax net and has increased the tax base. The GST framework has also provided a level playing field for all businesses, irrespective of their size and nature. The online system and digital records have improved transparency and accountability in the taxation system. Overall, the regulation of the unorganised sector has been a major objective and benefit of GST, leading to a more formalized and compliant economy.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Such benefits totally reduced the hassle of filing taxes, ensuring efficient indirect tax collection regime.</p>

                <h2>When is GST Deregistration Possible?</h2>
                <p>Entities that have already registered their businesses or ventures under GST, in later stages, might need to cancel or surrender their GST registration.</p>

                <p>There are several circumstances that prompt cancellation or surrendering of GST registration. These circumstances are discussed below -</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Turnover below the minimum limit</strong></li>
                </ul>
                <p>In case a business's turnover has fallen below the minimum threshold applicable in its respective state post GST registration, that company can apply for deregistration.</p>
                <p>For instance, business X, which operates in Maharashtra, had a turnover of Rs. 50 lakh when it got registered under GST. However, after several months, its annual turnover fell to Rs. 20 lakh. As the minimum threshold in Maharashtra for GST registration is Rs. 40 lakh, business X can choose to cancel its registration.</p>
                <p>Nevertheless, entities which supply goods to other states are required to be registered under GST irrespective of their annual turnover.</p>

                 <ul>
                    <li><strong>Discontinuation of business</strong></li>
                </ul>
                <p>If a business entity discontinues its operations, it needs to apply for a cancellation of its GST registration.</p>

                 <ul>
                    <li><strong>Change in business status</strong></li>
                </ul>
                <p>Businesses that undergo a transfer in the ownership status can apply for cancellation of GST registration.</p>

                 <ul>
                    <li><strong>Change in business constitution</strong></li>
                </ul>
                <p>A business needs to surrender its GSTIN registration if it has undergone any constitutional alteration and apply new for registration as per the current constitution.</p>
                <p>For instance, if a business has changed its constitution from a Partnership firm to a Private Limited Company, it needs to cancel its registration as a Partnership firm and register new under GST as a Private Limited Company.</p>

                <h2>How to Apply for Cancellation of GST Registration?</h2>
                <p>Individuals can submit their application for cancellation of registration with the Form GST REG-16. Taxpayers in question shall include the following details when filling the form -</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Details of inputs or raw materials along with goods in work-in-progress and finished goods in the inventory on the date of application for cancellation.</li>
                    <li>Liabilities, as shown on the Balance Sheet on the date of application for deregistration.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>An officer, who shall oversee the cancellation procedure, is then required to issue a formal order in Form GST REG-19 within a month from the date of application. This officer shall also decide the date from which cancellation would be effective and subsequently notify the taxpayer in question.</p>

                <p>Both GST registration online and deregistration are extensive procedures and hence, requires due diligence and comprehensive knowledge when filing. Taxpayers need to ensure they are updated regarding GST regulations and are in compliance with these laws if applicable to avoid legal consequences.</p>

                <p>Besides efficiency in the tax collection process, many businesses also enjoy a lower tax liability owing to a change in the indirect taxation system under the Goods and Services Tax Act. Thus, registering businesses for GST can prove to be beneficial in multiple aspects.</p>
